<h3 align="center"><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>The use of the Internet in higher education has increased
    dramatically in recent years, reflecting the rapid adoption
    of the technology by society. The entire history of the
    Internet can be described as less than three decades old
    (Hafner &amp; Lyon, 1996) and the World Wide Web (WWW) has
    been available only since 1992. In spite of these relatively
    short histories, the technologies are increasingly available
    and affordable to the public (Palin, 1997). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The Internet is a powerful tool for both instructors and
    students. One use of the tool is communication, which can be
    described as unidirectional or bi-directional. An example of
    unidirectional use is an instructor&#146;s use of a homepage
    on the WWW for distribution of course materials. An example
    of bi-directional use is e-mail correspondence between
    instructor and student. Examples of these two types of
    communication will be presented throughout this paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>To date, the utilization of such communication technology
    has been largely dependent on individuals&#146; efforts
    (Connell, 1996; Spotts &amp; Bowman, 1995). Thus, an
    instructor&#146;s interest level and technical proficiency
    have been the main determinants of what type of
    computer-mediated communication has been incorporated in
    college coursework. In spite of this, the use of computer
    technology and its inclusion in instructional design is fast
    becoming institutionalized. Researchers and educators expect
    it to become an integral part of education (&#147;Building
    the Syllabus,&#148; 1997; Griffin, 1995; Lawless, 1995;
    Schneider &amp; Block, 1995; Spotts &amp; Bowman, 1995; Wang
    &amp; Sleeman, 1993).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 align="center"><a name="Universities' Perspectives">Universities&#146;
Perspectives</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left">Universities increasingly support
    instructors&#146; individual endeavors and also have begun to
    institute campus-wide programs which standardize technology
    for both employees and for students. Universities&#146;
    motivation is at least two-pronged. First, they respond to
    demands of the marketplace, which includes responding to
    demands of students who have grown up using the technology.
    Second, they strive to use technology to reduce costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The first motivation is evident in the increasing number
    of distance education courses and entire degrees which are
    &#147;exported.&#148; The new technologies being used in
    distance programs minimize the constraints of distance and
    time on education (Rohfeld &amp; Hiemstra, 1995). Students,
    especially older and re-entry students, who seek to start or
    complete degrees with a minimum of disruption to their work
    and family lives are especially attracted to distance
    programs. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Many college courses are well-suited to computer-mediated
    communication so that some or even all on-campus meetings can
    be eliminated. As students have found such courses available
    at some universities, they have enrolled in those schools.
    The result is a growing competition among colleges and
    universities for this market segment. Even if a college has
    as its primary student body young, &#147;traditional&#148;
    students coming to campus directly from secondary school, it
    feels the motivation to incorporate elements of technology in
    coursework. Such schools realize that these young students
    are increasingly computer literate and expect to use
    technology in coursework. Thus, the technology is being
    incorporated in both distance and on-campus classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The second motivation addresses the increasing cost of
    running a university today. Even though technology requires
    high initial cost, it has the potential of reducing other
    costs in the long-term. Some examples of reduced costs
    follow.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fewer and lower salaries and employee benefits are
            indicated when the number of distance students
            increases. On-campus, full-time, and tenured faculty
            can be maintained in fewer number; part-time or
            adjunct instructors can be hired to teach Internet
            courses, regardless of their geographic location.</li>
        <li>Physical facilities need be maintained only for those
            studies which require meetings, e.g., laboratory
            sciences, coursework related to interpersonal
            relations, and coursework which demands face-to-face
            communication.</li>
        <li>Costs of paper and printing can be virtually
            eliminated. Savings may be passed on to students by
            eliminating course fees traditionally collected for
            the preparation of course packets. Too, in university
            administrative offices, paper and printing costs are
            lower, although some of these savings must be
            redirected to new costs of computer security and
            maintenance. Real savings will be realized in the
            electronic publication of catalogs, schedules, and
            other frequently revised documents.</li>
        <li>Resources such as libraries and research support
            centers can reduce their physical plant costs as
            stored information takes the form of digital media.</li>
    </ul>

        width="428" height="5"></p>
        <h3 align="center"><a name="E-mail">E-mail</a></h3>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Just as e-mail has changed communication in business, it
    promises to alter the way professors and students
    communicate. For example, educators can offer &#147;extended
    office hours&#148; by way of e-mail, inviting students to
    make inquiries in a text-based mode. Since a professor&#146;s
    answer can be sent back to the student with the push of a
    single button (&#147;reply&#148;), communication is faster
    and usually more clear than through use of telephone or voice
    mail. With campus-wide adoption of e-mail as the primary
    means of communication, a campus of the University of
    Minnesota found that the new system resulted in less
    telephone tag, less waiting at offices, and more access to
    people and information (Sargent,1995).</p>
    <p>E-mail also permits assignments to be submitted
    electronically. Some instructors choose to receive the
    assignments as private e-mail. Others require that students
    distribute their assignments to all members of the class via
    e-mail. Practical considerations include size of class,
    length of assignment, due dates within the semester, and
    computer lab access for students who do not own computers.
    When the logistics are handled well, this style of work is
    satisfying to both instructors and students. </p>
    <p>These benefits have been reported:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The medium promotes critical thinking and reflective
            communication.</li>
        <li>Students experience more discussion than in-class
            time allows.</li>
        <li>The relative anonymity of e-mail is attractive to
            some students who tend not to volunteer comments in
            class.</li>
        <li>Asynchronous communication fits all students&#146;
            schedules.</li>
        <li>Professors can observe the flow of communication
            before deciding how much or when to intervene with
            their own comments.</li>
        <li>Skill-building in the use of computers is achieved,
            especially by computer novices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The interpretive nature of Family Sciences information is
    a potential drawback in the use of e-mail, however. There may
    be a limit to the amount or character of use in the field
    because e-mail is nonverbal and not conducive to
    communication of highly interpretive language. It can also be
    described as relatively anonymous and status-levelling
    (Geser, 1996). Geser (1996) wrote of the language limitations
    of e-mail for the social sciences:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Of course, E-communication is most adequate in cases
        where words have a highly standardized and consensual
        meaning, so that there is no need to provide additional
        specifying cues. Thus, it will be used widely in
        scientific fields characterized by high paradigmatic
        development and formalized codes of expression
        (mathematics, chemistry etc.) and less in most social
        sciences or humanities, where imprecise definitions and
        nonconsensual terminological interpretations prevail. (p.
        6)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These aspects of e-mail may be important to instructors in
    the Family Sciences who seek to use e-mail to communicate
    with students and to evaluate that use. Zack (1995) addressed
    the issue in his report of using e-mail with undergraduates.
    He found that both he and students were more likely to use
    e-mail when issues were relatively unambiguous and factual.
    As questions became complex, the need for face-to-face
    meetings was obvious.</p>
    <p>Klein (1996) reported at the National Council on Family
    Relations (NCFR) that his experiences with e-mail as a
    pedagogical tool were highly dependent upon class size.
    Specifically, when the number of students exceeded 25, e-mail
    was less efficient and less effective.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="Benefits">Benefits of Using the
Internet and E-mail</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some benefits associated with the technology follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. Reflective thinking by students is encouraged when
    coursework is accomplished in asynchronous learning processes
    (Hiltz, 1997; Rohfeld &amp; Hiemstra,1995). For example, if
    an assigned reading is posted on the Internet and students
    are asked to post their comments about the reading, the
    ensuing discussion can take place over several days&#146;
    time. Students can read, think, read classmates&#146;
    postings, reconsider their own opinions, and finally post
    comments which are the result of more thought than would
    normally occur during an on-campus discussion in a single
    class session.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. Important information in curriculum material can be
    highlighted for students with animation, sound, blinking or
    reversed text, and graphics (Cates, 1991). Curriculum
    presentation can include images and color at a fraction of
    the cost of visuals in print materials. Animation and the
    other special features mentioned above serve students who
    retain information more efficiently when the information
    includes graphics. Randal Day (1996) of Washington State
    University reported that visual images representing family
    structure make a powerful impact on students. He created
    original art to accompany lectures; the art was also
    installed on students&#146; CD-ROM self-study modules. Day
    used the following software applications to aid in creating
    such images: Fractal Design Painter, Adobe Photoshop, and
    Poser.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>3. One of the strongest arguments for using the Internet
    for delivering curriculum material is the interactive nature
    of the medium. Some topics are especially well-suited to
    interactive exercises or immediate application. An example of
    interactive exercise might be a student&#146;s participation
    in a scholarly discussion in a chat room with a
    &#147;visiting professor&#148; or guest speaker. Depending on
    the student&#146;s level of expertise or level of comfort,
    such an exercise could even afford the choice between
    actively participating or lurking (listening but not making
    one&#146;s presence known). An example of immediate
    application might be the ability to follow hyperlinks from an
    assigned reading to related topics at WWW sites. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>4. Posting information about courses and distributing
    learning materials can be accomplished on the WWW with
    relatively little difficulty (Schneider &amp; Block, 1995).
    Little technical knowledge and virtually no expense are
    required. The author of such materials&#151;typically a
    professor or his graduate assistant&#151;can use Hypertext
    Markup Language (HTML) editing software to create materials
    in the format used for web sites. Netscape Composer, which is
    part of the Netscape Communicator suite (sometimes referred
    to as Netscape 4.0), is a sufficient HTML editor. It is
    available at no cost to educational users and can be
    downloaded from the Netscape WWW site. A more extensive
    editor, Microsoft FrontPage, costs about $140 retail and as
    little as $65 through vendors serving universities.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>5. The collaborative nature of the Internet promotes the
    utilization of teachers as facilitators instead of
    information transmitters (Schneider &amp; Block, 1995) and
    promotes students&#146; exploratory research (Schneider &amp;
    Block, 1995). While educators can reserve the right to
    lecture when that is an efficient means of delivering
    information, they can also use the new technologies to limit
    the traditional lecturer model, sometimes called
    &#147;sage-on-a-stage.&#148; </p>
    <p>6. Collaborative learning also provides motivation for
    most students: in preparing e-mail assignments, they are
    motivated to work hard because other students will be reading
    their work (Hiltz, 1997)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>7. One of the most powerful uses of the Internet is the
    publishing of books and reports by both faculty and students.
    It is also an area of great debate as academia decides how to
    value such publishing and how to manage practical aspects of
    it. Compared to print publishing, electronic or digital
    publishing offers greater speed to publication, lower cost,
    and wider distribution. All of these factors will encourage a
    larger number of writers. Whether readership will be
    increased is not known. However, writing and readership in
    narrow disciplines will almost certainly increase. When only
    a small audience (of a few hundred or a few thousand) is
    identified for a manuscript, print publishers are likely to
    pass on a project since recouping printing costs is not
    assured. By contrast, electronic publishers can produce the
    small-audience-document since the cost of posting it on the
    Internet is relatively small. Additionally, certain narrow
    audiences can be reached through the Internet, especially if
    computer users access material through filters which the
    publisher can identify as appropriate to the publication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="Problems">Problems</a></h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Some problems associated with the technology follow.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. Loss of regular and frequent face-to-face interaction
    may negatively affect the educational process. Instructors
    using distance technology report the need for special
    activities to establish rapport among students at the start
    of a course (Rohfeld &amp; Hiemstra, 1995). The effects of
    loss of interaction may not be fully felt or known yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. Large time commitments by instructors is widely
    reported (Hiltz, 1997; Hughes, 1996a; Kearsley, Lynch, &amp;
    Wizer, 1995;Lacina-Gifford &amp; Kher-Durlabhji, 1996;
    O&#146;Donnell, 1996). Compensation for faculty time for
    preparing new course materials is a continuing problem
    (Hiltz, 1997).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>3. Training for instructors and students is costly and
    ongoing (Sargeant, 1995). Those who are new to the technology
    are especially in need of specialized training. &#147;The
    amount of support novice users are likely to need cannot be
    overestimated&#148; (Rohfeld &amp; Hiemstra, p. 3). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>4. Limited standardization of hardware and software is
    evident on campuses. Competitive market forces have produced
    a multitude of possible computer configurations. The
    practical result on campus is that assignments must
    accommodate students&#146; various hardware and software, in
    terms of both access and skill level. Some universities
    address the problem by requiring identical hardware among all
    students and faculty. Sargeant (1995) described the solution
    by University of Minnesota at Crookston as a large-scale
    leasing program of IBM laptops for all students as well as a
    required introductory computer course. Other schools, such as
    Carnegie Mellon University, require that all incoming
    students take a course in specific software that is the
    standard for all assignments on that campus.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>5. Start-up, maintenance, and replacement of computer
    labs, classroom equipment, local area networks (LANs), and
    similar facilities are expensive in time and money. Schools
    usually must hire additional specialized personnel to
    maintain the facilities. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>6. Even with adequate support staff, a university faces
    continuing challenges in the technology. Hiltz (1997)
    reported that after a decade of experience with virtual
    classrooms at New Jersey Institute of Technology, technical
    and logistical problems persist although they change in
    nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>7. Through fees or personal expenses, students share the
    cost of technology. Some are unable to meet or resistant to
    such costs (Hiltz, 1997).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>8. Internet technology poses legal and ethical dilemmas in
    the areas of intellectual property, copyright, and privacy.
    Intentional violation of laws and rights is not necessarily
    the larger problem, although violations such as plagiarism
    are well-known in educational communities. The greater issue,
    at least during the current rapid expansion of the
    technology, is universities&#146; and instructors&#146;
    unintended errors in publishing student information and
    student work. For example, a tour of course homepages on
    university servers can turn up class rosters, student home
    phone numbers, even Social Security numbers. Instructors have
    posted such information on web pages without thinking about
    the inherent public access. Access can be limited by setting
    passwords for entry to course homepages, but often faculty
    opt to forego passwords because of their own or
    students&#146; irritation with the process. Similar privacy
    issues surround the posting of students&#146; work.</p>
    <p>9. Procrastination by students is sometimes a problem if
    classes do not meet on a regular and frequent basis; students
    may postpone work and fall seriously behind (Hiltz, 1997).
    Timeliness of required e-mail submissions is also jeopardized
    by unexpected technical problems (for example, if the
    university server is &#147;down&#148; or a student&#146;s
    computer at home malfunctions). Such problems are exacerbated
    if the student has procrastinated and is relying on the
    technology on or near the due date for an assignment.</p>
