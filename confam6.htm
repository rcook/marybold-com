            Apparently not. American society is fairly brimming with a wide
            variety of family forms. (Some are detailed in the next section on
            Vocabulary.) As noted before, nuclear family composition has been an
            idealized but not typical form.&nbsp;
            <p>But problems do emerge from our various meanings of <i>family.</i></p>
            <p>Problem #1: how do definitions translate to public policy? Who is
            a dependent when that word has monetary value? When does the state
            become a stakeholder in a family unit (in the case of foster
            families, for example)?</p>
            <p>Problem #2: how are newer forms of family received in their
            communities?</p>
            <p>Problem #3: by recognizing and supporting all forms of family,
            does society fail to encourage forms that promote the greater good?</p>
            <p>Problem #4: discussion of family is downright cumbersome since
            one or multiple <i>operational definitions</i> may be required.
