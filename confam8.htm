          <td width="100%">In 1926, Ernest Burgess wrote this definition of
            family:&nbsp;
            <p align="center">a unity of interacting personalities</p>
            <p>Journals published in the decade following reflect how popular
            Burgess and his definition were. Frequently referenced, the phrase
            became a common operational definition in research as well as a
            standard in essays and editorials.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(Burgess taught sociology at the University of Chicago for 50
            years until his death in 1966. His textbooks and writings of the
            1920s and 1930s are credited with shaping the direction of sociology
            in the U.S. His research included the family as a social unit,
            marriage stability, and the prediction of marital success. Burgess
            is generally regarded as the founder of family studies.)
