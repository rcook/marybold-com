<p><a name="Introduction">An interactive study</a> unit titled
&#147;Roles of Grandparents: Playmate, Mentor, Caregiver&#148;
was created for use with 26 undergraduate students in a Social
Gerontology course. The unit, an HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
document, was introduced to students as a required component of
the course. It was available for access through the Department of
Family Sciences home page on the Internet.</p>

<p>The authors designed the project with three student-oriented
goals. The first goal was to increase student familiarity with
the Internet and with computer mediated communication (e-mail),
thereby promoting critical thinking and reflective communication.
The second goal was to encourage students&#146; use of materials
outside of class to prepare for in-class discussion, thereby
using class time for the processing, rather than the delivery, of
information. The third goal was to support students&#146; use of
the technology to access Internet sites pertinent to Family
Sciences, thereby stimulating students to make use of the
Internet for their studies.</p>

<p>Students were required to submit two e-mail messages answering
questions posed in &#147;Roles of Grandparents.&#148; Students
were also required to access other Internet sites that were
relevant to the course. After all students had completed the
assignments, the instructor distributed a course evaluation which
included survey questions about students&#146; experiences with
and opinions of the computer component.</p>

<p>&#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; was written as a hypertext
document for delivery over the Internet. This topic was chosen
because of the emphasis on the new role of grandparent currently
in Family Sciences curricula. &#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148;
presented recent research about grandparents alongside references
to the classic literature frequently cited in undergraduate
textbooks.</p>

<p><font color="#000000">The authors used the 10-step procedure
outlined below in their work. Steps 1 through 3 constitute the
planning stage of the project. Steps 4 through 8 are concerned
with the design and construction of the hypertext document. Steps
9 and 10 comprise the publication stage.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Step 1"><strong>Step 1</strong></a><strong>:
Determination of purpose, topic, and depth</strong></p>

<p>Purpose: The purpose of a hypertext document should be stated
much as the purpose of any published document is stated. While
the medium of the Internet demands a different style of
publishing than print publishing, the statement of purpose for
both should be concise and focused. The nature of electronic
publishing allows the following special features to be included
in a publishing purpose: asynchronous communication,
interactivity, electronic storage, choice of format (for example,
on-screen or print-out), and so forth.</p>

<p>The purpose of &#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; was to
present curriculum material for access by students over the
Internet. As a first effort by the authors, &#147;Roles of
Grandparents&#148; was viewed as an experimental teaching tool
and therefore an additional purpose was to assess efficacy of and
student reaction to such a presentation.</p>

<p>The choice of topic for a hypertext document may be considered
from the aspect of utilizing the technology to best advantage.
For example, the document can include recent developments or
recent research, since the time from event to publication can be
short. Information can be revised frequently, also. Some topics
are enhanced by graphic images. The cost of images (in color, 3D,
and motion) in electronic documents is a fraction of the cost in
print documents. Some topics are similarly enhanced by
interactivity with the student. Hypertext, even at its most
elementary use, involves the student by giving choices with links
to more material.</p>

<p>Grandparenting was selected as the topic for this project
because of curriculum emphasis on new roles of grandparents in
family and society. The topic was addressed in limited space in
the textbook for the course. Recent sources could be included in
this hypertext document. Although heavily text-based, the
document was organized in quiz format which involved the student
in making selections and &#147;jumping&#148; to new screens of
information.</p>

<p>Hypertext materials can be designed to be &#147;broad&#148; or
&#147;deep.&#148; A broad document provides hyperlinks to many
topics or to many web sites. Such links aid in broadening the
scope of the study. A deep document links to more detailed
information about the topics, perhaps to definitions or examples
of specific terms or to complete documentation of an idea. The
linking power of HTML supports both goals equally well.</p>

<p>For this project, the authors focused on only three roles of
grandparents and limited the amount of information conveyed. The
authors chose this path in order to avoid students&#146; feeling
overwhelmed by a large amount of reading. This decision was based
on an assumption that for the large majority of students,
&#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; would constitute their first
curriculum reading in this medium. In order to serve the more
experienced computer users among the students, challenge was
provided in the large number of study questions provided for
student choice in the assignment. Half of the study questions
could be answered briefly and easily; the other 15 questions
invited critical thinking and more complex answers. (A small
number of students did select some of these more difficult
questions.) </p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Step 2"><strong>Step 2</strong></a><strong>:
Compliance with regulations and guidelines</strong></p>

<p>Inherent in the electronic publishing process is the necessity
of recognition of publishing requirements, especially when
university server space is to be utilized. Requirements and
guidelines affecting this work included the University&#146;s
rules, copyright law, and other universities&amp;#c resources.</p>

<p>Rules: As a relative newcomer to Internet publishing&#151;a
status shared by the majority of U.S. universities&#151;the
University&#146;s technical services currently center primarily
on hardware and access issues. At the time of the authors&#146;
work, rules regarding publication were limited to specifying who
may authorize the creation of a web page and the requisite name,
e-mail, and date to appear on every home page.</p>

<p>Copyright law: The law and ethics of copyrighting constitute a
challenge in the digital environment. Knowledge and understanding
of copyright law has never been widespread. In an environment
that permits (some would say, promotes) copyright infringement
with ease, as is the case in the digital environment, that
knowledge and understanding is virtually nonexistent. As a
result, copyright infringement has become routine by some
computer users. Lawmakers suggest that copyright laws in the U.S.
should be revised in light of the evolving computing environment.
In the meantime, professionals using computers and the Internet
should adhere to the restrictions of copyright law and set an
example for students to do the same.</p>

<p>The authors of &#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; strived to
follow all standards regarding the use of copyrighted material.
Copyright law was a factor in the selection of three graphics
used in the hypertext document. One graphic, a sandwich
representing multiple generations and the &#147;sandwich
generation,&#148; was selected from a collection of clip art
available on CD-ROM. As is typical of most clip art sold for
computer use, the image can be used in virtually any fashion
other than re-sale as an illustration.</p>

<p>Another graphic, a head-and-shoulders representation of an
older male, was scanned from a pen-and-ink drawing. The drawing,
by artist Carol Small of Arkansas, was purchased as a work for
hire for an earlier print publishing project by one of the
&#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; authors. Such re-use of an
illustration is appropriate when the copyright holder grants
permission for the use. In this case, the copyright holder was
not the artist since the drawing was sold by the artist as a work
for hire. In such a situation, the purchaser becomes the
copyright holder and determines all future uses of the work. The
copyright holder granted permission for use of the image in all
print and electronic versions of &#147;Roles of
Grandparents.&#148;</p>

<p>The last graphic, a vine on a pole representing &#147;beanpole
family composition,&#148; was scanned from a pen-and-ink drawing
by one of the authors. The copyright holder granted permission
for use of the image in all print and electronic versions of
&#147;Roles of Grandparents.&#148;</p>

<p>Other universities&#146; resources: The educational community
is historically a sharing community. In the electronic age,
educators continue in this tradition. Consequently, there is a
great deal of information about instructional technology
available through web sites.</p>

<p>The authors located several electronic publishing guides at
the web sites of other universities. Most helpful was material
produced by TeamWeb at the University of Texas at Austin. These
guidelines address general publishing concerns, copyright, and
electronic mail, as well as technical concerns such as web page
design and use of HTML.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Step 3"><strong>Step 3</strong></a><strong>:
Determination of available resources</strong></p>

<p>Resources for HTML authoring (and electronic publishing, in
general) are increasing in number and in quality. How-to
information has become commonly available in a very short period
of time. Scholarly research on uses of HTML documents and related
educational tools remains limited, especially in comparison with
the extensive use of such tools. Local resources are sometimes
available not only in universities&#146; technical services but
in other departments and colleges.</p>

<p>Reviewing others&#146; work on the WWW, including syllabi and
course materials, was especially helpful. The authors also
learned from advice and example by professors in three other
departments at and by speakers at a national conference. </p>

<p>For example, practical tips were garnered at the NCFR Workshop
on Instructional Technology at the 1996 Annual Conference in
Kansas City. Dean Busby of Syracuse University recommended that
educators bypass their campus servers and use the Internet. David
Klein of the University of Notre Dame stated that a class size of
about 25 is the (practical) maximum number of students in a
course which includes e-mail communication. Randal Day of
Washington State University offered his interpretation of the
impact of visual images for the MTV generation. This type of
information, reflecting educators&#146; first-hand experience,
influenced many of the authors&#146; decisions in this project.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"

<p align="center"><a name="Step 4"><font color="#000000"><strong>Step
4</strong></font></a><font color="#000000"><strong>: Software and
hardware considerations</strong></font></p>

<p>HTML code&#151;the basis for hypertext documents to be viewed
on the WWW&#151;can be written in any word processing program as
a text file. Authoring in this manner requires learning HTML, one
of easier, higher-level computer languages.</p>

<p>Most educators prefer to use a software program called an HTML
&#147;editor&#148; rather than learn HTML. An editor allows the
user to ignore much of the actual code, since the software
automatically writes it &#147;behind the scenes,&#148; as the
user enters text on a screen similar to a word processing screen.</p>

<p>An Internet browser such as Netscape or Explorer is used to
preview the HTML document. Thus, the user can see exactly how the
document will appear on the Internet before it is uploaded to the
WWW.</p>

<p>Virtually any Windows 95 computer has sufficient hardware to
run this type of software. Computers with less than 16 megabytes
of RAM (Random Access Memory) may have fewer software choices
among full HTML editors. </p>

<p>For &#147;Roles of Grandparents,&#148; the authors worked with
two editors. The first draft was prepared with Macromedia
Backstage Designer Plus. Final work was done with Microsoft
FrontPage. Both editors are full feature programs; FrontPage
includes more web management tools. The authors found FrontPage a
more intuitive program and more user-friendly.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Step 5"><strong>Step 5</strong></a><strong>:
Structural layout of the home page</strong></p>

<p>Hypertext permits flexibility in document layout and page
design. Parenthetical information and more detailed information
can be organized in pages off the main document. For the student,
the obvious benefit is selection of detail as needed. </p>

<p>For the author or teacher, the less obvious benefit is a novel
approach to organizing material. While the process is
time-consuming, the resulting document is strengthened by
features such as indexed content, cross-referencing, quick access
to a glossary, and access to more detail (for example: original
text, raw data, hypertext links to sources). Utilizing computer
technology and HTML, authors can create lengthy and complex
documents at virtually no publication cost other than labor.</p>

<p>In &#147;Roles of Grandparents,&#148; the authors utilized
hypertext layout for interest hooks in the form of quiz
questions. In answering the quiz, students followed links to
research-based curriculum material. (Students&#146; answers to
the quiz were not recorded and students were advised of this.)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Step 6"><strong>Step 6</strong></a><strong>:
Display options and preparation of text and images</strong></p>

<p>At present, most WWW access involves the use of graphical
browsers produced by Netscape and Microsoft Corporation. Text
browsers such as Lynx are also in use, but by fewer people.</p>

<p>The current standard for display on the WWW and graphical
browsers is home pages created in HTML. Graphic images can be
incorporated easily in HTML as GIF files. </p>

<p>The majority of campus computers for student use provide
Internet access with the browser Netscape Navigator. A smaller
number of computers on campus display Microsoft Explorer.
Although all students have free Internet access with Lynx, the
authors decided to proceed as though Lynx would be used rarely or
never. This was based on informal conversations with students in
the Department.</p>

<p>Components of &#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; were prepared
as either HTML or GIF files. A total of 27 HTML files and 3 GIF
files were created.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Step 7"><strong>Step 7</strong></a><strong>:
Construction of the main menu</strong></p>

<p>As in any publication, the electronic document should open
with a clear and interest-provoking introduction. In print,
publishers and authors rely on elements such as abstracts,
introductions, book covers, and graphics. On the WWW, publishers
and authors can use any of the same elements&#151;or all of them.
For example, the opening screen may resemble a book cover with
graphics. It may include links to other screens where the
abstract or the introduction may be found. Other links might
allow users to go directly to a references section or to related
sites by the same authors or by others in the field.</p>

<p>The main menu of &#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; was
designed so that students would immediately recognize it as the
correct &#147;place&#148; to find their assignment. Graphic
images were arranged for quick loading and also so that they
would be visible in a partial or full view on even small
monitors. Thus, the user would immediately see the options
represented by the three images. (This assumes that the type
sizes on the user&#146;s computer would be similar to those
specified in the HTML code. The issue is discussed further in
Step 8.)</p>

<p>On-screen instruction was kept to a minimum, allowing users to
move into the quiz directly. To support first-time users, the
authors prepared a printed page of information which the
instructor distributed to students.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Step 8"><strong>Step 8</strong></a><strong>:
Inputting text and graphics</strong></p>

<p>HTML has a limited range of typesetting options. For example,
only six levels&#151;or sizes&#151;of headings exist. Although
more variety in type size can be achieved with graphics, such
strategies are not intuitive for the beginning or occasional HTML
author.</p>

<p>Similar constraints exist for body type. HTML provides a
&#147;normal&#148; size and several smaller sizes typically
reserved for footnotes and the like. Some usual typesetting
options, such as italic and underlining, are of limited value
since they do not always present clear, readable text on all
monitors. The boldface option is safer to use.</p>

<p>Any available typeface on a computer system can be
incorporated in HTML; however, if a receiving system does not
have the same typeface, it will substitute with a default face.
Thus, a carefully typeset document using Optima and Bookman faces
might be downloaded on a user&#146;s system with Helvetica and
Courier New. Similarly, background colors and colors of links
(active and visited) can be controlled by the user through
preferences selected to act as defaults overriding HTML code.
Default type sizes can also be selected: vision-impaired users
may direct their computers to load all web sites with 14- or
18-point type, for example.</p>

<p>End users&#146; view of the electronic document may differ
dramatically from the document as it was uploaded to the
Internet. This fact should influence HTML authors in design
decisions in at least some matters. For example, knowing that the
majority of end users are unlikely to have Palton Light loaded as
a typeface, use of the face would simply bring up a font
substitution. Better to design the page with the more standard
serif face, Times Roman. The vast majority of users will have
Times, or Times Roman, or Times New Roman on system and therefore
will see the screen as designed (or with only tiny differences in
size or spacing).</p>

<p>Another source of design concern is not knowing what version
of browser the end user may have. For example, on campus,
computers display a range of Netscape Navigator, from version 2.0
to 4.1. Certain screen and typeface views differ according to the
version of browser. The arrangement of text in a table created in
version 3.0 may not be supported under version 2.0, for example.
While the text may appear on screen, it may not be in the
intended format. Similarly, if an early version of browser does
not support frames, entire web sites may not be accessible.</p>

<p>In designing &#147;Roles of Grandparents,&#147; the authors
chose to use Times Roman as the typeface. Not only is the
typeface a common one on computer systems, but it is also the
most &#147;readable&#148; of proportional faces in the U.S.
Readability refers to the ability of the human eye to scan and
interpret characters. Times Roman is, for practical purposes,
transparent to the American reader: it does not attract
attention. Only standard HTML type sizes were utilized. These
choices, along with the decision to forego a frames layout,
accommodated what the authors considered likely browser versions
ranging from Netscape Navigator 2.0 to 4.0. </p>

<p>Graphic images are incorporated in HTML documents using two
file types: GIF and JPG. Usual pronunciations are jiff (less
frequently, giff) and jay-peg. Graphics are easily identified
with the appropriate file extensions (image.gif or image.jpg).
Well-suited to photographs, the JPG format provides rich shading.
(In print, the equivalent would be graphics produced in process
color, or four-color CYMK.) Although image data is compressed in
all file formats, JPG files are relatively large and
slow-loading. The GIF format, by contrast, produces an image in a
relatively small memory space and is consequently quick-loading.
Line drawings are good candidates for GIF files, as are colored
images that can be reproduced with a limited number of colors.
(In print, the equivalent would be graphics produced with spot
color.) With some degradation expected, photographs can be
scanned, converted to GIF format, and used on the Internet. </p>

<p>All images in &#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; were well
suited to the GIF format. Produced as small graphics for the main
menu, the three load relatively quickly. On subsequent pages, the
same images appear in larger size and take longer to load.</p>

<p>Two of the images (man and beanpole) were pen-and-ink line
drawings owned by one of the authors. They were scanned and
converted to digital format, and saved as GIF files. The third
(sandwich) was computer clip-art. For this purpose, it was
converted to GIF format.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Step 9"><strong>Step 9</strong></a><strong>:
Uploading the program to an Internet site</strong></p>

<p>Files can be uploaded to the Internet using FTP (File Transfer
Protocol) software. HTML and graphic files can be uploaded
together. Gaining access to a server is the first step. In most
university settings, uploading to official homepages is a task
reserved for specific individuals with coded access. </p>

<p>At the University, faculty, staff, and students enjoy space on
the University server for individual homepages. Uploading can
therefore be accomplished by any individual with a University
e-mail account. However, since &#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148;
was to serve as curriculum material for students, the authors
opted to submit the program for inclusion in the homepage of the
Department of Family Sciences. There, it is part of a subsection
called Electronic Publications of the Department. </p>

<p>As a Department publication, &#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148;
could be uploaded to the Internet only by the Department
secretary. The task involved uploading 27 HTML files and 3 GIF
files. Total time was about five minutes; the actual transfer of
a single file was typically measured in seconds since &#147;Roles
of Grandparents&#148; was not a large-memory program.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Step 10"><strong>Step 10</strong></a><strong>:
Periodic review of the home page</strong></p>

<p>Electronic documents should be reviewed by authors to insure
that hyperlinks continue to operate. If links are provided to
outside URLs, the need for review becomes critical. The nature of
the Internet is one of change, which means that related sites
(and additional sites related to those sites) may be altered at
any time. With regular review, authors can determine if their own
document needs revision to reflect changes in linked URLs.</p>

<p>&#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; uses only relative URLs in
its links. This means that all the links are to areas within the
Department of Family Sciences home page. Consequently, the need
for on-line review is not great. The authors did, however, test
all links and view all screens in order to confirm that what
students would find did indeed match the program submitted for
uploading to the Internet.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Student Assignment"><font
color="#000000"><strong>Student Assignment</strong></font></a></p>

<p>Students were instructed to access &#147;Roles of
Grandparents&#148; on the Internet. Class time was scheduled in a
nearby computer lab and students were instructed on how to enter
the URL on Internet browsers. The instructor accompanied the
students to the lab and assisted students when asked. A small
number of students elected to access the program from home or the
University library. Written instructions were provided. </p>

<p>&#147;Roles of Grandparents&#148; included 30 study questions
regarding the content. Students were told to select any two
questions and submit answers to the instructor via e-mail. The
answers were to include an introductory sentence such as,
&#147;This is Jane Doe answering question #1&#148; and to be
limited to no more than 250 words each. The instructor announced
that answers could be statements of opinion, although students
were also encouraged to incorporate information from textbook
readings, lecture notes, and class discussion. Students were
advised that the majority of scoring points would be awarded on
the basis of two answers being transmitted electronically.
Further, writing mechanics such as spelling and format would not
be evaluated. A due date was set for 3 weeks, with the assurance
that students needing personal help at that point would not be
penalized for late submissions.</p>

<p>The second requirement was to access several web sites
pertinent to the subject of social gerontology. The instructor
provided a list of examples but also encouraged students to
explore the Internet on their own, using search engines to locate
other URLs. Students were not required to document their results,
although about half the students did print out information from
web sites as reference material for another assignment for the
course.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="Results"><strong>Results of the E-mail
Component</strong></a></p>

<p>Twenty-six students submitted answers to two questions of
their choice. The numbered questions were as follows:</p>

<p>1. List personal behaviors or shared activities which might
identify a grandparent as a playmate to grandchildren.</p>

<p>2. Many researchers comment on the diversity of family forms
and styles of grandparenting. How might such diversity relate to
Emick and Hayslip&#146;s suggestion that established
grandparenting roles in the research literature are not accurate
now?</p>

<p>3. How does the playmate style of grandparenting integrate the
norm of noninterference?</p>

<p>4. If you have observed the norm of noninterference within an
extended family, describe how it was evidenced. (Spoken,
unspoken, circumstance causing it to be invoked or noticed,
result, etc.)</p>

<p>5. How do modern transportation and high-tech tools affect
family communication?</p>

<p>6. Construct a model of a fictional &#147;scattered&#148;
family and predict annual costs of visits and communication.</p>

<p>7. What are possible trends for extended families of the
future regarding contact between generations?</p>

<p>8. Some researchers hold the opinion that today&#146;s
grandparents&#146; detachment from younger family is harmful,
even though most older people say their detachment is their
preference. What is your opinion?</p>

<p>9. What is the impact of increasing life spans on how central
grandchildren are in grandparents&#146; lives?</p>

<p>10. What may be the effect on &#147;grandparent
consumerism&#148; as baby boomers enter their 60&#146;s (after
the year 2005)? What assumptions does this question make?</p>

<p>11. What historical factors have made parent-child
relationships egalitarian?</p>

<p>12. The diversity of American families may or may not support
an &#147;egalitarian&#148; view. Comment with examples.</p>

<p>13. How important is family harmony?</p>

<p>14. What are some possible positive and negative family
reactions to an elder mentor?</p>

<p>15. If your family has included an elder mentor, comment on
his or her personal characteristics which contribute(d) to the
role of mentor.</p>

<p>16. Which of these mentoring-style roles do you think
predominates in the U.S.? [Listed were mentor, &#147;the national
guard,&#148; surrogate parent, historian, role model, wizard,
nurturer.]</p>

<p>17. Do these roles indicate one-way or reciprocal
relationships?</p>

<p>18. If most households in the past did not include the
elderly, how have we come to adopt an image that they did?</p>

<p>19. Do you think grandchildren will be a &#147;rare
commodity&#148; in the future?</p>

<p>20. What are some of the factors which affect
step-grandparenting? Will those factors be any different in the
future?</p>

<p>21. Comment on this statistic: 33% of older people are
step-grandparents. (Discuss any aspect of what this statistic
means to you. If you do not feel sure about drawing conclusions,
compose a list of pertinent questions.)</p>

<p>22. What concerns, questions should we have in reviewing
longevity statistics, fertility and mortality rates, family
composition statistics, etc.?</p>

<p>23. Why might a caregiving grandparent choose not to secure
legal guardianship/adoption of a child, even when the
child&#146;s parent is not in the child&#146;s life?</p>

<p>24. Using non-emergency situations, list some of the normative
circumstances in an American child&#146;s life which call for
informal or formal consent by an adult.</p>

<p>25. What are possible results of caregiving grandparents&#146;
inability to secure preventive health care for children?</p>

<p>26. Should we consider 12% an important figure? [Comparative
statistics were listed: 12% of African-American children live
with grandparents, 6% of Hispanic-American children live with
grandparents, 4% of European-American children live with
grandparents.]</p>

<p>27. How can we sort out health, family, and economic causes
when reviewing research? What emphasis does ethnicity deserve?</p>

<p>28. Do the above statistics reflect &#147;more problem&#148;
for African-Americans, or &#147;more solution&#148; by
African-Americans?</p>

<p>29. We have cited researchers&#146; conclusions about African-
and Euro-American households [regarding multigenerational
households]. What exceptions should we consider, if any?</p>

<p>30. Can we draw conclusions about &#147;extended family
structure&#148; in light of the relatively short history of the
U.S. and the influence of immigration during that history?</p>

<p><strong><u>Timeliness of Submissions</u></strong></p>

<p>Most students completed their assignments in the allotted
time. Two students submitted their e-mail late but did not
require additional assistance from the instructor.</p>

<p><strong><u>Content of Answers</u></strong></p>

<p>Most of the students&#146; answers were characterized by
personal experience. Virtually every student made a personal or
family reference in at least one answer. More than half of the
students related a complete &#147;family story&#147; in at least
one answer.</p>

<p>A minority of students included reference to other course
materials or class lectures in their answers. Six students&#146;
answers evidenced critical thinking and application of knowledge
which may have been gained during this course in social
gerontology.</p>

<p><strong><u>Grading</u></strong></p>

<p>The computer component comprised less than 10% of the grade
for the course. All students received at least 40 points, or 80%,
based merely on making two e-mail submissions before the end of
the semester. Points above this minimum were based on
completeness of thought (within the constraint of 250 words per
essay), application of course content, and, to some extent, the
student&#146;s willingness to answer difficult questions rather
than easy ones. Spelling, grammar, and other mechanics (including
format and layout) were not evaluated.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="COURSE EVALUATION BY STUDENTS"><strong>COURSE
EVALUATION BY STUDENTS</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Instrumentation</strong></p>

<p>A custom instrument was developed for course evaluation of
this computer component. The instrument was designed to reflect
requirements of the course, using the terminology used in the
classroom. Before writing the evaluation survey, the instructor
reviewed surveys previously used in research or course
evaluation. The survey consisted of questions for demographic
data, 30 agree-disagree statements about the computer component,
and 10 open-ended questions.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Procedure</strong></p>

<p>The course evaluation for the semester centered on the
required computer component. The instructor distributed a print
survey to students during a class break on a date following all
students&#146; completion of the assignment. The survey was not a
required element of the course, although all students present
completed the form.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Results of Course Evaluation</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Demographic data</u></strong></p>

<p>All but one student were female. Of the 24 respondents, 58%
(n=14) were between the ages of 20 and 26, and 42% (n=10) were 26
or older. Twenty-one students indicated their college majors: 15
were in the Family Sciences Department, 6 were in Psychology.</p>

<p><strong><u>Answers to open-ended questions</u></strong></p>

<p>Forty-two percent (n=10) of the students indicated some level
of discomfort at first hearing of the Internet component.
Comments included &#147;a little fear,&#148;
&#147;overwhelmed,&#148; &#147;scared and nervous,&#148;
&#147;anxious,&#148; and &#147;panic.&#148; Most of these
students also commented that they expected the assignment to be
difficult to complete. Most were first-time e-mail users; they
were evenly split between traditional and nontraditional.</p>

<p>Almost as many students (n=9) expressed pleasure or excitement
at hearing of the assignment. Their comments included
&#147;excited,&#148; &#147;happy to have opportunity,&#148;
&#147;surprised, happy,&#148; &#147;great,&#148;
&#147;curiosity,&#148; and &#147;something different is
good.&#148; Most said they expected the assignment to be easy to
complete. Only two of these students were first-time e-mail
users. Again, they were fairly evenly split between traditional
and nontraditional.</p>

<p>Of the remainder, about 21% of the sample (n=5), three were
traditional students and two were nontraditional students. Their
comments were &#147;It did not phase me,&#148; &#147;Just another
busy-work assignment,&#148; &#147;that is would be easy,&#148;
&#147;I was not excited about it,&#148; and &#147;It&#146;s about
time.&#148;</p>

<p>From the entire sample of 24, 92% said they had adequate time
to complete the Internet component; only 2 students said time was
not adequate. </p>

<p>Some students added comments about lab conditions:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;a qualified person should be [in the lab] for
    assistance to those needing it,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;there needs to be sufficient number of computers for
    students,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;too much class time devoted to using an inadequate
    computer lab.&#148; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Usually, at least one or two computers in the lab were down.
Some students worked together at a station. All computers in the
room were networked to one laser printer.)</p>

<p>In answering the question &#147;What did you like best/least
about the Internet component,&#148; students made these comments:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;most? Getting on-line and exploring,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;worst&#133;my own fears about using it,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;best&#133;how easy it really was and how my
    curiosity is now peaked about using the Internet,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;most&#133;learn new thing (i.e.,
    e-mail),&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;least&#133;responses were harder to edit when
    typing on the e-mail screen rather than typing on a word
    processor,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;easy and took less time than having to write a
    paper on it,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;most was just going through and getting
    information,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;I had never used e-mail before and it was confusing
    for me,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;I like the fact that there was a E-mail
    component,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;Computer work is a great option to incorporate into
    class settings. The problem I foresee and have run into is
    that some students already know about using a computer,
    e-mail, Internet, etc., while others may not; therefore some
    students are frustrated because they don&#146;t while others
    feel it is moving too slow because they already know
    it,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;overall using a computer for assignments is
    faster,&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;I disliked the fact that there weren&#146;t enough
    computers in lab; I liked the fact that I was allowed to use
    my home computer.&#148;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#147;&#133;like relating the use of technology to real
    life!&#148;</p>

<p align="center"><a name="Discussion">Discussion</a></p>

<p>The successful implementation of the required Internet
component of this course allowed realization of three
student-oriented goals for the project. The first goal was to
increase student familiarity with the Internet and with computer
mediated communication, thereby promoting critical thinking and
reflective communication. The second goal was to encourage
students&#146; use of materials outside of class to prepare for
in-class discussion, thereby using class time for the processing,
rather than the delivery, of information. The third goal was to
support students&#146; use of the technology to access Internet
sites pertinent to Family Sciences, thereby stimulating students
to make use of the Internet for their own inquiry into recent or
ongoing work, not just for this course but in their future
studies.</p>

<p>An unexpected characteristic of students&#146; e-mail
submissions was the large number of personal stories related.
This amount of discussion on personal experiences could not have
been accommodated during class time.</p>

<p>Practical considerations for the authors were the time
required for the research and writing of the &#147;Roles of
Grandparents&#148; document and technical problems in the
creation stage. For all of the authors, this represented a
first-time effort. A log sheet of work hours would have been
helpful in evaluating these stages of work. The authors agree
that an estimate of 150 hours is reasonable. They predict much
less time commitment would be required for a subsequent project.</p>

<p>For the instructor, practical considerations included timing
of the component within the semester, scheduling of labs, and
making time available during class and between class to discuss
the project with students. Some discussion with students centered
on specific questions about the assignment or the delivery of
e-mail. However, most out-of-class discussion focused on
student&#146;s first-time user status, their need for support,
and their private requests to ask &#147;a stupid question&#148;
about how e-mail works or how the Internet developed.</p>

<p>The instructor felt that a limit for length (250 words) for
each e-mail submission helped control the amount of on-screen
reading time (by the instructor) as well as prevented the
assignment from seeming overwhelming to students. Only a few
students approached the maximum word count. Most wrote between
100 and 150 words.</p>

<p>Errors in spelling, grammar, and writing mechanics were
common. Most students clearly were concentrating on the process,
not the product. Too, the instructor gave verbal instructions
only for inputting messages directly into the e-mail program. No
directions were given for importing spell-checked text (in blocks
or in files) from a word processor.</p>

<p>The instructor emphasized on several occasions that a goal of
the computer component was to introduce new technology in a
friendly, stress-free manner. On the day the computer component
was first announced, about one-third of the students asked
questions and expressed concern about the requirements. One
student approached the instructor after class and asked if she
should drop the course because of her inexperience with
computers.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Thin_Red_and_Blue7130.gif"
width="428" height="5"></p>

<p align="center"><a name="IMPLICATIONS">IMPLICATIONS</a></p>

<p>Using the Internet for delivery of course materials has
numerous implications for students, faculty, and university. Such
use eliminates the cost of printing and duplication of
assignments. The technology imposes no extra costs to students,
assuming they have access to personal, laboratory, or library
computers.</p>

<p>The technology allows flexibility in scheduling on-line
viewing and allows for options by students in printing out
assignments. As students gain experience with such assignments,
the flexibility may yield increased efficiency in students&#146;
preparation for class. This flexibility is constrained somewhat
if instructors tie the assignment to scheduled computer lab time.
However, if course material can be accessed on the World Wide
Web, students can review or continue work from home or other
computers.</p>

<p>When curriculum web pages include hypertext-based readings,
the format engages students whose learning style is well-suited
to interactivity. It appears that the technology can broaden
educational reach to diverse student populations, especially
those who have been unable to travel to campuses. Also, e-mail
communications and on-line discussions are formats which
stimulate comment from students who may be reluctant to share
ideas in class.</p>

<p>Educators in the Family Sciences will need to learn new
technical skills as well as devote considerable time to exploring
Internet sites in order to remain current on opportunities and
resources worldwide, As demand for electronic publication via the
Internet increases, these requirements on faculty will also
increase.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="SUMMARY">SUMMARY</a></p>

<p>&#147;Roles of Grandparents,&#148; an HTML-based document
available to undergraduate students through a web site, was
created as a required component in a social gerontology course.</p>

<p>The authors determined that 10 steps were necessary in
creating a home page for curriculum material. The first 3 steps
constituted the planning stage of the project: determine purpose,
topic, and depth; comply with regulations and guidelines;
determine available resources. Five steps were concerned with the
design and construction of the hypertext document: consider
software and hardware options; lay-out the home page; consider
display options and preparation of text and images; construct the
main menu; input text and graphics. The last 2 steps comprised
the publication stage: upload the program to an Internet site;
review the home page periodically.</p>

<p>Certain practical considerations guided decisions in this
project. The HTML document was designed to accommodate viewing
with a variety of Internet browsers and with the most common
typeface options of personal computers. Assignments were short so
as not to overwhelm students new to the technology. Grading
standards were liberal and the instructor promoted an atmosphere
of anxiety-free learning. The authors estimated that their first
effort required about 150 hours of preparation.</p>

<p>The students perceived numerous difficulties arising from
required computer components in their coursework. Chief among
them were fear, anxiety, and learning to send e-mail. Some
students complained about computer lab conditions.</p>

<p>The students also perceived benefits of the required computer
component. Most considered using a computer fun and they were
pleased to have had the assignment. Some students said that
sending e-mail responses to the instructor was faster than
preparing a traditional assignment.</p>
