      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>GLBT family is a term slowly
      gaining in popularity to refer to families headed by parents who describe
      their sexual orientation as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (GLBT).
      A variation&#151;LGBT—also appears in both scholarly and lay literature.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Judith Stacey (1998) called this
      family form the only new structure to emerge in many centuries. In the
      U.S., attention to GLBT families arose in the 1980s. Of course, throughout
      human history homosexuals have parented children. What is new is the open
      acknowledgment of GLBT parents, frequently residing with same-sex
      partners.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Research in the 1990s essentially
      supported the notion that children in GLBT homes develop normally and
      happily. One way of looking at this is the typical description of family
      life in America: people with kids spend their time at school carnivals,
      soccer practice, and Disney movies. These events are the constants that
      dominate family life</b></font><font color="#996633"><b>—not parents&#146;
      sexual orientation. Thus, GLBT families are busy with much the same
      activity as all other families.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>GLBT families do face special
      problems, however, starting with what terminology to use to describe
      parents in the home. For one lesbian couple, the terms of choice are
      &#147;Mom&#148; and &#147;Leesa,&#148; who is described outside the home
      as &#147;my step-mom.&#148; For another couple, the terms of choice are
      &#147;Mom&#148; and &#147;Uncle Paula.&#148;&nbsp; (See also <a style="text-decoration:none" href="confam18.htm" target="main">co-parent</a>.) </b></font></p>
