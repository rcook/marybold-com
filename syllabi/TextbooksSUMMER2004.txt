Green, S. B., & Salkind, N. J. (2003). Using SPSS for Windows and Macintosh: Analyzing and understanding data (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. ISBN: 0-13-099004-3 (paperback).

SPSS Student Version 11.0 for Windows [statistical software on CD-ROM] ISBN: 013-0348465

Special Note About Software: you may find these two items packaged together at a price that makes the software cost only about $10 - $15. While our course work will utilize SPSS Student Version 11.0, this does not mean you must purchase this software if you already have a version of SPSS on your computer. Pull-down menus may vary slightly from your version to 11.0, but the assignments will focus on basic procedures that you should be able to adapt to any version of SPSS. (Similarly, if you are familiar with statistical formulae and Excel or other computing software, you are welcome to use that other resource.) You WILL need the Green & Salkind book for assignments.
