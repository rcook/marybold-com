<h3><font color="#804000"><a name="Cost of Publishing">Cost of Publishing</a></font></h3>

<p><font color="#804000">The production budget for an adult, nonfiction paperback book
regularly exceeds $25,000. Budgets grow according to style of book (hardcover,
illustrated, color) and editing requirements (reference material, textbook) and size of
market (limited audiences driving the cost up the most). So, a budget of $50,000 or
$75,000 is pretty routine. Those figures also explain why so few authors are published:
every book represents an investment of money by a publisher.</font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">By contrast, the cost of launching a web page is about $200. Even
a well-designed commercial site with many bells and whistles can be maintained for about
$5,000 a year. These are extremely low start-up costs and do not fully translate for
scholarly or research-related publishing. (The researchers benefitting most from the low
cost of electronic publishing are individual university faculty and organizations. Since
most of what they publish themselves is not peer-reviewed material, editorial costs are
relatively low.)</font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">Scholarly publishing&#151;of a journal, for example&#151;on the
Internet obviously saves on the physical costs of PP&amp;B (paper, printing, and binding),
but editorial costs are the same as in the print world. For what is to many publishers a
painful transition from paper to electronic forms, editorial costs have actually risen.
Once the investment in hardware, software, and training is complete, peer-review journals
will start reaping the benefits of paperless publishing. Electronic journals are already
well established in several disciplines, but in the Family Sciences such a transition has
not occurred.</font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">Skeptics fairly ask, isn&#146;t the best material still in print?
Will scholarly press ever really go on-line? At present, yes, print sources of scholarly
work outnumber electronic sources. But economics alone will drive the transition to
electronic journals and electronic libraries. Once on-line, journals and subscribers alike
will add immediacy to their reasons for supporting the change in format.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#804000"><a name="Two Meanings of Filter">Two Meanings of Filter</a></font></h3>

<p><font color="#804000">Traditional meaning: bad information is filtered out of the
publishing pipeline through editorial review, peer review for journal articles, editorial
supervision for books, even cost analyses by CPAs. Bad research, bad writing,
mean-spirited material&#133;all are kept to minimum through the normal filtering process.
On the Internet, of course, little or no filtering is guaranteed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">High-tech meaning: as the volume of information increases, we
need filtering devices to preview the information and select only that which we want/need
to see. For example, a therapist who wants to keep abreast of research, readings, and
statistics on domestic violence needs a robot program in the computer to filter the new
information coming online and then tag and organize anything related to domestic violence.
(Such a robot is sometimes called an information agent or news filter.)</font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">Some search engines currently offer free news-sorting services.
For example, My Yahoo is a customizable &#147;home&#148; page that you can program to
automatically load your preferred news topics every time you log on to the Internet. (You
can also have automatic updates on weather in several cities, your stock market holdings,
your favorite sports teams, etc.)</font></p>

<h3><font color="#804000"><a name="Evolutionary Scheme of Things">Evolutionary Scheme of
Things</a></font></h3>

<p><font color="#804000">Assuming that the Internet is a growing thing (known) which can
improve (hoped), we can look for progress in the future. Some progress is tied to
technology: as Internet backbones develop, we gain speed and power. Beyond that, progress
is hard to predict, but presumably capability will include tricks we literally
haven&#146;t thought of yet. Automatic filing of journal articles we tag? Automatic filing
of relevant articles we <em>don&#146;t</em> tag? Automatic e-mail to distribute same?
Information agents that can predict our interest in a new topic? All of these activities
are possible now, with simple pre-programming. They may soon be possible with much less
pre-programming. </font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">Information scientists are currently working on faster, smarter
ways to build hierarchies of useful websites without requiring human evaluation. Some
tools that we are accustomed to seeing in citation indexing are being used, but new
artificial intelligence tools are being developed, too.</font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">A crucial element in this evolution of information handling is
the librarian. As a curator of information, the librarian must be skilled at not only
locating reserves of knowledge but also at creating access for other people. For example,
a university librarian today cannot merely take requests from faculty members for
literature searches. While a great arrangement for university faculty, the old system bogs
down: the literature base is deeper and wider now and the librarian cannot be expected to
make all the search decisions. Too, the librarian&#146;s time is more limited today: just
keeping up with new technology requires continuing education and training. The librarian
must, then, find ways to facilitate the faculty&#146;s access and use of information
technology.</font></p>

<h3><font color="#804000"><a name="Librarian's Nightmare">Librarian&#146;s Nightmare</a></font></h3>

<p><font color="#804000">Our current status in the cataloging of information is a
librarian&#146;s nightmare. The companies behind the major search engines (DEC, for
example) will certainly influence the future direction of organization. What we can say
for certain is that organizing the flow of information is beyond the scope of the Dewey
Decimal System and the Library of Congress System. In the first place, those systems were
designed for different technologies. In the second place, they represent our American
traditions. The Internet is an international entity. Our Western habits and preferences
are merely that&#133;habits and preferences.</font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">One habit of just a few hundred years is our expectation of
permanency of a library of printed information. Relatively few things are permanent on the
Internet! Our keepers of information are faced with the task of archiving sound and
animation in addition to more familiar written and visual works. For scholars, the
temporariness of many Internet publications prevents use of material that must be, by
academic definition, retrievable. Scholars may need to start archiving Internet materials
themselves if they are not sure that their academic libraries are preserving materials in
their field.</font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">Whole courses (actually, whole degrees) speak to the question of
how to evaluate information sources. Evaluating electronic sources, then, deserves more
study than this overview. Still, most of us&#151;with no formal training in the
discipline&#151;will be expected to be able to evaluate information, select sources, and
recommend web sites to customers or clients. </font></p>

<h3><font color="#804000"><a name="Teaching Undergrads">Teaching Undergrads</a></font></h3>

<p><font color="#804000">As quickly as we learn how to evaluate electronic sources
ourselves, we are asked to guide undergraduate students in doing the same. In some
courses, our goal is simply to introduce students to the Internet and begin the necessary
skill-building which will allow them to use computers in study and in employment.
Eventually, our goal must extend to the evaluation of information. In the family sciences,
this is a double challenge. The ambiguity of much of family sciences knowledge confounds
evaluation. </font></p>

<p><font color="#804000">Drs. Martin, Engelbrecht, and Chenoweth speak to this issue in
their article &#147;Effectively Teaching University Family Life Education: Selected
Methods&#148; (published in <u>Family Science Review</u>, Feb/May 1994). The methods
reviewed are all classroom techniques which allow students to &#147;experience the
ambiguity of the content. [Students] readily see that answers to family life are beyond
the textbook.&#148; As we increase our use of the Internet in research and education, we
will find new applications of the TWU professors&#146; observation on &#147;the ambiguity
of the content.&#148;</font></p>
