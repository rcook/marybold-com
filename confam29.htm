      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Designations such as PLF help in
      our discussions of employment for family members. Especially women have
      experienced labeling and stereotyping regarding their work status. </b></font><font color="#996633"><b>&#147;Working
      women&#148; may refer to women working in the paid labor force&#151;or just
      as accurately to women who maintain home or family without ever receiving
      a paycheck.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Using a term such as PLF helps to
      be specific: parents in PLF means the parents receive monetary
      compensation for their work (and that would not exclude self-employed
      individuals).</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>By the same token, </b></font><font color="#996633"><b>&#147;non-working&#148;
      does not necessarily mean &#147;no paycheck,&#148; although for most of us
      it does refer to the parent at home. Unfortunately, the language serves to
      de-value work in the home.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Some informal language can help:
      at-home parent, at-home mom, at-home dad. Such terms can help clarify our
      meaning, at least until we learn what words the family prefers. For some
      people, &#147;housewife,” &#147;househusband,&#148; and &#147;homemaker&#148;
      just don&#146;t satisfy. And neither do &#147;working woman&#148; and &#147;working
      mother.&#148; Interestingly, we have not heard complaint from men about
      being labeled &#147;working men&#148; although many at-home fathers have
      been frustrated with the lack of language to describe their own choice of
      location.</b></font></p>
