            <p>Research into people&#146;s definitions of family tells us that
            although we all agree on using the term, we don&#146;t agree on what
            it means. How many people form a family? One study reported a range
            of 0 to 40 members (Trost, 1990).&nbsp;</p>
            <p>What boundaries frame family? Some people call parents and children a family. Others wouldn&#146;t think to draw such a small
            circle, but rather extend the boundary to include cousins and more.
            For some, the boundary includes animals. For some, an extension is
            made for deceased relatives.</p>
            <p>Family may refer to blood relations, but may also mean fictive
            kin&#151;sometimes to the exclusion of blood relatives. In fact,
            biological criteria rarely form the basis for naming family. Neither
            do legal or residential descriptions (Jorgenson, 1989). Family is
            more frequently described as the system of relations that develops
            from everyday contact (Jorgenson, 1989) and is reinforced by the
            members&#146; gathering for celebrations and rituals. Behavior and
            communication, then, may better indicate family membership.</p>
            <p>Does this mean family can mean anything? The researchers confirm
            this: the definition of family is highly subjective and boundaries
            of family are drawn very differently.</p>
            <p>Since composition is so varied, it is hard to define family, and
            impossible to depict a typical one. In the family field, few experts
            try to define it, but continue to rely on the word&#151;to refer to
            any set or system of relations calling itself a family.</p>
