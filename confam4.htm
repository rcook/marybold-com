            traditional &#133; standard &#133; normal &#133; and ideal carry a powerful message of <i>deficit model.</i> 
            So, “nuclear family” implies that if a family’s composition is
            different, then it is non-standard, abnormal, or less than ideal.
            <p>#2 Problem: “Nuclear” frequently makes an assumption about
            gender roles, including employment of women. Typically, this has
            been the “Ozzie and Harriet” model. (Of course, Harriet Nelson
            in real life was not an unemployed at-home mother.)</p>
            <p>#3 Problem: Nuclear family with an at-home mother has never
            actually reflected the statistically typical American family. In
            1940, 41% of American families could be labeled “Ozzie and Harriet.”
            In
            1960, the figure was 43%. In short, the majority of American
            families has never matched the common image of nuclear family in
            terms of having an at-home mother.</p>
