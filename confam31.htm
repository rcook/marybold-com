      ago, would have referred to a widow or widower with children. Today, the
      term can refer to any adult caring for a child, although we usually mean
      it as the adult who is solely <i>legally</i> responsible for most of a
      child&#146;s care. Note that the parent need not be the only nurturer in
      the child&#146;s life, however, and may not even live alone with the
      child. All of these scenarios could be labeled single parenting:</b></font></p>
