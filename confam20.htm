      <p align="left"><b><font color="#996633">Fathering has emerged as a new
      issue in parenting, most identified with younger men who express a
      commitment to sharing in all aspects of parenting their children.
      Prominent in family field literature since the early 1990s, fathering has
      become a regular topic in the popular press, as well. Almost always,
      fathering is addressed in terms of men who live with their children, not
      in terms of non-residential or non-custodial parenting. (See also <a style="text-decoration:none" href="confam23.htm" target="main">good
