      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Parenting has become the word of
      choice in terms such as parenting support, parenting education, parenting
      skills. We are seeing more and more program names replace &#147;Parent
      Education&#148; with &#147;Parent<i><u>ing</u></i> Education.&#148; The
      change may appear slight, but meaning can be altered with an <i>-ing.</i>&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>&#147;Parenting&#148; shifts
      emphasis away from the <i>who</i> of nurturing children to the <i>process</i>
      of nurturing children. Part of this equation is that our traditional
      definition of parent may not be appropriate for a family. Many children
      are reared by grandparents or other extended family. Some are nurtured by
      foster families; fewer grow up in group homes. All the adults in these
      scenarios are nurturing, or parenting, children. They just happen to not
      be <i>parents</i> in the traditional sense.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>The older terminology: </b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>parent training</b></font></li>

      </ul>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>The shift in language also helps
      remove stigma in programs of parenting education, parenting instruction,
      and parenting training. Older terminology implied that the family field
      sought to educate, instruct, or train parents&#151;which could be interpreted
      as family experts assuming that parents were ignorant of proper parenting
      standards. Newer terminology makes an offer of education about parenting,
      instruction in parenting methods, and training in specific skills. </b></font></p>
