      Miva Order is a customizable browser-based order form and order processing
      system. It can be personalized with specific color, graphics, product
      descriptions and other layout options. Businesses simply incorporate a
      link from the web page where their products are sold, permitting customers
      to seamlessly access the order form and make purchases.<br>
      Users are able to create and manage custom product order forms with
      provisions that simplify the process of calculating sales tax, shipping
      costs and currency formatting.<br>

      </a>Allows visitors to your on-line shopping site to collect items in a
      virtual shopping cart over multiple product web pages without losing the
      items ordered.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cart keeps track of what the shopper has
      ordered with a SID (Shopper I.D). There are no cookies used, so the
      software will work through a firewall and with older browsers.<br>
      Shoppers may view the contents of their shopping cart at any time and may
      add or delete items as needed. The program automatically calculates the
      subtotal, sales tax, shipping charges, and grand total. When a visitor
      decides to checkout, the order information including the buyer's name,
      address and billing instruction is emailed to your order department (or
      whomever you choose) and a receipt is sent to the shopper.<br>
      </font><font color="#000000">Operation Details</font><font color="#000000"><br>
      The shop.pl program is used for all web pages used in the Shopping Cart.
      It is passed arguments on the URL path. All the web pages used are parsed
      by Shopping Cart. The page argument tells the Shopping Cart which HTML
      page to parse. All of these HTML files used by the Cart software must be
      in the $shopping_root directory, specified in the shop.cfg file. These
      HTML pages cannot be in subdirectories of the $shopping_root. Each HTML
      page is parsed and various tokens are searched for. These tokens tell
      shop.pl where to put the shopping cart list, the SID number, and other
      information. The SID number is passed on every URL in the Shopping Cart.
      This is how the Shopping Cart keeps track of the user. If no SID is passed
      to shop.pl, then it creates one.<br>
      <br>
      The product information is kept in a text database, which consists of:
      product number, product i.d., product description, price, and product
      weight separated by a pipe symbol. This database is searched when the
      shopping cart list is displayed. It is also searched when the items
      ordered are mailed to the web administrator.<br>
      <br>
      The customer can be presented with a shopping list, which allows then to
      add more of the same items or remove items. The shopping list also shows
      the item descriptions, the item prices, the shipping cost, the subtotal,
      the tax cost, and the total. The shopping list is shown only if the
      shopping list token in included in the HTML of the shopping cart pages.<br>
      <br>
      When the customer is done ordering they will checkout using the email
      form. This form collects data about the customer. This data is emailed to
      the storefront owner and the customer in a receipt. This receipt of course
      includes the items ordered, shipping costs, tax, subtotal, and the total.
      The credit card information is only emailed to the storefront owner.<br>
      <br>
      The credit card information is not emailed to the storefront owner if the
      Cybercash or Secure modules are in use. This information is either stored
      in a file on the server (Secure Module) or sent to the Cybercash Server (Cybercash
      Module).<br>
      <br>
      A search feature is included which allows the customer to search the
      product database for product descriptions that interest them.<br>

      </font></b><font size="2">The search engine receives the input from the CGI form and processes the required files in order to find the search terms.<br>
      </font><font size="2">The list of files is found in /www/user/dirscan/fileinfo.txt. The script would not work if it doesn't get the valid list of files. For compiling the list of files to process use the dirscan.pl utility (so you're actually getting two separate projects,
      disrcan.pl can be used separately for creating a valid list of your files on the disk).</font><b><font size="2"><br>
      Search algorithm<br>
      </font></b><font size="2">For every search term that is found in a file, a file gets one point. Thus if the search string was &quot;really cool perl script&quot;, and the opened file contained the word &quot;really&quot; 0 times, word &quot;cool&quot; 3 times, word &quot;perl&quot;
      11 times and word &quot;script&quot; 1 time, the resulting point count would be 15 points.<b><br>
      Search engine features<br>
      </b>The search engine is case-insensitive, thus &quot;pErl&quot;, &quot;Perl&quot;, &quot;perl&quot; and &quot;PERL&quot; would be treated the same. The location of the search engine on the system is not sensitive, as long as it can get get to the valid list of files
      provided in the fileinfo.txt file.<b><br>
      Is it the right one for me?<br>
      </b>The search engine is optimized to work with the sites containing up to 300 documents, after that level the performance of the engine tends to be slow (since it has to open every file and count the number of points the file gets). By default it searches the documents
      with &quot;*.htm&quot; extension, but that can be tweaked in the script.<b><br>
      How do I exclude files from the search?<br>
      </b>There is no option to exclude files from the search, if you want them excluded, an option for excluding directories exists in dirscan.pl, if you don't want a specific file to be indexed, exclude it from fileinfo.txt, and do it every time you run dirscan.pl, which
      basically re-indexes your system and compiles a new list of valid files.<b><br>
Can I customize the results screen?<br>
      </b>The results of the search can be published with the header and the footer, to provide HTML customization, the header and footer should be located in ../search/header.txt and ../search/footer.txt, if you don't need a header and a footer, comment out the function calls
      print_header() and print_footer() in find.pl.<b><br>
      How the results are published?<br>
      </b>The results are published as the filenames on your Unix machine, not as the titles.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"><br>

      At this stage NewsPro should be fully installed and working. Go back to http//hostingsupport.com/newspro/newspro.cgi and add a news item.<br>
      The next step it to make your web pages work with NewsPro.<br>
      When you <b>Submit News</b> to NewsPro it is stored in a database file. <b>Build News</b> takes the news entries from the database and builds them into web-usable files. If you install addons, you may end up building several files in several different locations, but NewsPro
      always builds a file called <b><i>news.txt</i></b> in your /newspro directory.</font></p>
      <i>
      <p><font size="2">news.txt</font></i> <font size="2"> contains HTML but is not a complete web page and should <b>not</b> be viewed directly in a web browser. It is designed to be <b>included</b> into an HTML page (often your site's home page).</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">SSI (server side includes) is used to add the text to your web page. When you include an SSI in your web page, you are telling the server to merge together two separate files before showing your page to the person visiting your site.<br>
      In order to use SSI in a web page, you will need to give the page an extension of <b>.shtml</b> rather than .html.<br>
      The exact SSI code you use to include <i>news.txt</i> depends on where <i>news.txt</i> is located in relation to the HTML file it is being included it. If both files are in the same directory, use<font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
      <br>
      &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;news.txt&quot; --&gt;</font><br>
      <br>
      in your HTML file at the point where you'd like your news to appear.<br>
      If your HTML file and <i>news.txt</i> are in different directories, use the <b>relative URL</b> from your HTML file to <i>news.txt</i>. For instance, if the locations of the respective files are <i>http//www.yoursite.com/index.html</i> and <i>http//www.yoursite.com/newspro/news.txt</i>,
      use</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">
      &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;newspro/news.txt&quot; --&gt;<br>
      <br>
      NOTE don't forget to change the index.html file name to index.shtml<br>
      </font><font size="2"><br>
      (Be sure that you've submitted and built news, otherwise there's nothing to include.)<br>
      Once news.txt is being generated and included into your page, you should have a working news system set up. If you post a news item, it will appear on your page. NewsPro is capable of much more than this. You can change what your news items look like,
      you can archive news items and create different categories of news.<br>

      This page, (http://hostingsupport.com/shop/boutique.html), displays the
      products from which your shopper may choose. Edit this page in any manner
      you choose, just being careful to maintain the four major parts of the
      html tags that interact with the program: <br>
      Call to program - this is the opening form statement where the
      &quot;action&quot; is a call to the /www/username/cgi-bin/shop/boutique.cgi
      program. <br>
      Products Listings - you will see nine separate parameters that must be
      used to define each product....the value of each parameter may be anything
      you choose, or they may also be equal to (&quot;&quot;) nothing. All nine,
      however, must be used for each product listed on the page. <br>
      Customer Information - this section is used to collect your shopper
      shipping and payment information. You may collect any amount and type of
      information you desire, being sure to repeat the field names on the
      saleslip.html page for presentation of this information to your customer. <br>
      Customer options - this section contains a hidden input line, sending the
      program a value for &quot;Operation&quot; and the &quot;submit&quot;
      button. <br>
      saleslip.html - <br>
      This page presents the final sales slip to your shopper, indicating
      products purchased and giving a total order summary. Notice that certain
      sections on this page interact with the program, and are expressed as
      hidden input lines. However, all sections with are involved in displaying
      data on the web page may be designed in any manner you choose. Just carry
      the field names from your product page forward on this saleslip page for
      display. <br>
      thankyou.html - <br>
      This page will present the order number to the customer and is the final

<font face="Times New Roman"><strong><u>CGIemail:</u></strong>This is a program
that will email you the forms filled out from the web.<br>
<br>
Here's an example -<br>
<br>
Create a text file called &quot;example&quot; in the main web directory.<br>
This is the content of the file:<br>
<br>
<br>
To: joe@blue.com<br>
Subject: example<br>
<br>
<br>
This is a test message.<br>
This is a test message.<br>
name: [name]<br>
phone: [phone]
<p><br>
<br>
That is the file that will be sent to joe@blue.com.<br>
Now, <strong>cgiemail</strong> will automatically replace [name], [phone],
anything<br>
in the brackets with the corresponding user supplied info from the web<br>
form. Also, you MUST have the To: and the Subject: line followed by<br>
the blank line. Those three lines MUST be on the FIRST THREE lines. You<br>
cannot change the From: address.<br>
<br>
Here is a part of the web form page called &quot;example.html&quot;<br>
<br>
<xmp>
<form method="post" action="/cgi-bin/cgiemail/example">
  <input type="text" name="name" size="2">Your name? <input type="text"
  name="phone" size="2">your number? etc...
  </xmp><br>
  <br>
  If you want to have your own customized &quot;success&quot; page, place the
  following<br>
  line in your form page:<br>
  <br>
  <xmp>
  <input type="hidden" name="success" value="http://hostingsupport.com/somepage.html">
  </xmp><br>
  It will then redirect to somepage.html.<br>
  <br>
  <p><strong><u>Formmail</u></strong> is a very easy to use form processor,
  simply place the following on any page after entering your domain.<br>
  <p><b>&lt;FORM METHOD=POST ACTION=&quot;http://hostingsupport.com/cgi-bin/formmail.cgi&quot;&gt;<br>
  &lt;input type=hidden name=&quot;recipient&quot; value=&quot;sales@hostingsupport.com&quot;&gt;<br>

  &lt;input type=hidden name=&quot;return_link_title&quot; value=&quot;Back to
  Main Page&quot;&gt;<br>
  <p></b>Be sure to replace hostingsupport, with your real domain name

  mail to info@hostingsupport.com, you will get the text file mailed back to you.<br>
  That's it. Try it out. There is no limit to the number of these<br>
  infobots. Note that the name of the file is simply &quot;info&quot;, and not<br>

  <a name="10"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">How do I use Real Audio?</font></a><br>
  <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
  </font>RealAudio is a real time audio transmission/player system. A digital
  audio stream is transmitted from the server over the internet to the
  destination and played immediately, rather than being stored to disk first and
  then played.
  <p>Each audio clip requires two files: a metafile with extension .ram, and the
  digital audio clip itself, with extension .ra. The .ram file holds one or more
  lines of ASCII text, each of which references the .ra file to be played when
  the .ram file is accessed by the browser.
  <p>Entries in .ram files have the form:
  <p>rtsp://machine.propagation.net/your-domain/name-of-clip.ra
  <p>Place your .ram and .ra files in the realaudio subdirectory under your web
  directory.
  <p>.ram files must be uploaded in ASCII mode while .ra files must be uploaded
  in BINARY mode.
  <p>You may then access these files at realaudio/file.ram under your www
  directory.<br>

  <p>Normally, any text(such as your credit card number) sent from your browser
  to the web server is sent as plain text. This means that a hacker could
  potentially intercept(however unlikely) the information sent from your browser
  and read it.<br>
  However, by using the secure server, the information is encrypted before it is
  sent from your browser. It would be practically impossible for anyone to
  decrypt it without knowing the key.<br>
  Please use the secure server only when necessary.
  <p>Assume your domain is hostingsupport.com.<br>
  <p>Use the following url to access your pages via the secure server.</font></font>

  <h3><a name="18"></a>SOLUTIONS TO COMMON PROBLEMS</h3>
  <p>&nbsp;
  <h4><a name="32"></a>Access logs</h4>
  <p><i>&quot;I can't find my access log!&quot;</i>
  <p>They are in your home directory, this is the directory you are in when you
  first logon.<br>
  <p>&nbsp;
  <h4><a name="Error_Logs"></a>2.1.2) Error logs</h4>
  <i>&quot;I can't find my error log?&quot;</i>
  <p>We don't keep error logs for performance reasons.
  <h4><a name="33"></a>Cgi-bin scripts</h4>
  <p><i>&quot;Where do I put my cgi-bin scripts?&quot;</i>
  <p>Put them in the subdirectory cgi-bin which should be under your www
  directory.
  <h4><a name="34"></a>Perl scripts</h4>
  <p><i>&quot;I am being told file not found&quot;</i>
  <p><i>&quot;I am being told No such file or directory&quot;</i>
  <p>Upload your Perl script in ascii mode, not binary mode.
  <p>Sometimes it seems like this is asked about once a day, so we're going to
  repeat it, loudly.
  <p>
  <note class=warning>
  <strong>Upload your Perl script in ascii mode, not binary mode. </strong>
  </note>
  <p><i>&quot;I get errors such as
  <pre>
Literal @sdfsdf now requires backslash at ./test.rob line 2, within string
Execution of ./test.rob aborted due to compilation errors.&quot;
</pre>
  </i>
  <p>Place a &quot;\&quot; before such offending @ characters. This is an
  incompatibility between Perl 5 and Perl 4.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <h5><a name="36"></a>Anonymous ftp</h5>
  <p><i>&quot;Where should I store files for anonymous ftp access?&quot;</i>
  <p>Put files in the directory named anonftp/pub. This will allow a file to be
  accessed by a customer with ftp://hostingsupport.com/pub/your-file-name.
  <p>For security the following applies<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Only the incoming directory can be written to anonymously<br>
    <li>Subdirectories are not creatable<br>
    <li>The incoming directory is not readable by people dropping files there<br>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <h5><a name="37"></a>Setting permissions</h5>
  <p><i>&quot;Hey, how do I stop people who are not in my group from reading a
  directory?&quot;</i>
  <p>Type <tt>chmod o-r directory</tt> while you are in the directory above it.
  <p><i>&quot;I don't care if people in my group can read my directory, but I
  don't want them to write in it!&quot;</i>
  <p>Type <tt>chmod g-w directory</tt> while you are in the directory above it.
  <p><i>&quot;Who is in my group?&quot;</i>
  <p>In general, each domain has its own group. If you find you are in the group
  users, let us know if you wish for your domain to have its own group.
  <p><i>&quot;Tell me more about permissions, they sound neat!&quot;</i>
  <p>To list the access permissions of a file or directory, type <i>ls -ls *</i>.
  r=read access, x=execute access, w=write access. The first three letters apply
  to you, the second three letters apply to your group, the last three letters
  apply to everyone else. Execute access enables you to run programs or enter
  directories.
  <p>Examples of using chmod:
  <pre>
    PEOPLE                                    PERMISSIONS
    u = the file's user (or owner)            r = read access
    g = the file's group                      x = execute access
    o = others                                w = write access
    a = the user, the group, and others.

    chmod a+w =  let everyone write to the file
    chmod go-r = don't let people in the file's group or others to read
                 the file
    chmod g+x =  let people in the file's group execute the file
</pre>
  <h5><a name="39"></a>Don't have permission to access /</h5>
  This error message means that you are missing your index.html file.
  <p>Note that files that start with a &quot;.&quot; are hidden files. To see
  them, type ls -al at shell prompt.
  <p>If you wish to ftp this file in, go to the /home/fred directory assuming
  your userid is fred.
  <p>&nbsp;
  <h5><a name="310"></a>I get a forbidden when trying to access my site</h5>
  This error is generally because you have not placed a default page in the main
  directory.<br>
  A default page must be called index.htm, or default.htm and it should be your
  main page<br>
