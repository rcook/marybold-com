      staggered employment schedules so that any time one parent is at work, the
      other parent is at home. Historically, off-shifting has probably
      frequently been a feature
      of parenting when all the adults in the family were employed. In the
      1990s, the strategy gained public attention. By some estimates, as many as
      20% of two-parents-employed families use off-shifting to allow for
      parental care of children. </b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Some possible benefits of
      off-shifting: children are always cared for by a parent, more
      extracurricular activities for children are possible, savings in child
      care costs, increased earnings on the job(s).</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Some possible drawbacks of
      off-shifting: lack of couple time, high stress, incomplete family time,
      sleep deprivation.</b></font></p>
