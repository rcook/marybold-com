          <td width="100%">Prior to 1940, records about women&#146;s employment were
            not as detailed as they are today. During some decades, women&#146;s
            participation in the paid labor force (PLF) was reported as 10%; in
            other decades, as 20% and 30%. We can be certain that for some
            women, especially married ones, paid labor was under-reported,
            however.&nbsp;
            <p>Many women received pay for day labor such as cleaning and
            ironing. Many took in boarders or cooked for work crews, frequently
            serving food from their own kitchens and porches. Eggs and
            vegetables produced in family gardens were sold at market. Sewing,
            which could be performed at home, was contracted by the job. Too,
            barter arrangements among neighbors for child care, nursing care,
            cooking, and so forth, represented paid labor although it was rarely
            acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The historical picture of at-home unemployed mother, then, is
            probably not accurate for most of our ancestors. Our problem in
            tracing women&#146;s employment is one of lacking <i>operational
            definitions</i> and changing standards in the collecting and
            reporting of statistics.</p>
