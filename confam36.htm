        <p><font color="#996633"><b>Historically, American society could be
        depicted as a population pyramid. The broad base represented the large
        number of children born. The mid section reflected a typical death rate
        for generations born before modern medicine. The top of the pyramid
        represented the small number of old people still alive.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#996633"><b>Today, the pyramid is more like a big block.
        There is little tapering off even near the top (the aged) of the
        population. For families, this means that several generations are alive
        at the same time.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#996633"><b>A beanpole depicts this situation: at the
        top is the oldest generation (in this drawing we might label that G1 for
        Generation #1) and at the bottom is
        the youngest (G5). The bean plant has growth at specific points &#151;
        birth cohorts about 20 - 25 years apart. </b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#996633"><b>In the block of the current American
        population, the beanpole is becoming typical across the entire society.
        In the historical pyramid shape, a beanpole would occur for a narrow
        segment of the population. The longest-lived family line would run from
        the base to the apex, but the pyramid could not accommodate very many
        tall beanpoles running up the center of it.</b></font>
