      Frank Furstenberg to describe the contradictory view of fathers in
      contemporary America.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b> &#147;Good&#148; dads
      participate in their children&#146;s upbringing. (See also <a style="text-decoration:none" href="confam20.htm" target="main">fathering</a>.)</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b> &#147;Bad&#148; dads, by
      contrast, leave their families and do not provide any type of support for
      their children.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Such a contrast of fathers has
      become a stark descriptor of American society. For some fathers, the good
      dad/bad dad syndrome is even more stark&#151;because they may be both types
      simultaneously.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>The acronym SOD has developed to
      refer to &#147;start-over dads&#148; who, in a second marriage, are
      rearing children differently than in the first marriage. The term
      invariably indicates that with the second family, the man is a &#147;good&#148;
      father, spending more time with children. This is sometimes attributed to
      the father being in a more established stage of career and therefore
      enjoying more leisure.</b></font></p>
