      replacement for &#147;broken homes,&#148; a term that can generate a
      broken nose as easily as a nod of the head.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>(&#147;Broken homes&#148; does
      not offend everyone, obviously. However, it has become an automatic phrase
      by many who have never actually considered the words. A good rule of thumb
      is to reflect on the meanings a child might place on the phrase. If a
      child would be confused or, worse, worried about the phrase, then it
      should probably be replaced. That doesn&#146;t mean we have to sugar-coat
      our words. After all, &#147;divorce” is a logical noun and verb that
      shouldn&#146;t be replaced with <i>your parents&#146; decision to terminate
      their marital commitment. </i>But &#147;broken home&#148; connotes a lot
      more than &#147;divorce.&#148;)</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>In 1971, Paul Bohannon wrote of &#147;divorce
      chains&#148; as the pathways between households that maintained ties after
      divorce. More than twenty years later, Andrew Cherlin and Frank
      Furstenberg revisited the vocabulary question and suggested that &#147;remarriage
      chains&#148; is more accurate. The concept of chain or link is especially
      helpful today as we chart the connections between many households <i>and
      across many generations.</i> Four and even five generations are becoming
      the norm for families, increasing the number and scope of family links.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Another factor promoting linked
      households is the gradual decline in fertility rates. As young families
      opt to have fewer children, the older generations may want to increase
      their contact (links) with any child they can. For example, my grown
      children may decide to not have children. But they might marry people who
      have children. As an aging woman in search of grandchildren, I might
      pursue a relationship with those step-grandchildren, adding another link
      to their already-existing chain that has two sets of grandparents. In this
      way, my home would become linked to theirs, in spite of the fact that I
      had not divorced or remarried, and, in fact, my son or daughter hadn</b></font><font color="#996633"><b>&#146;</b></font><font color="#996633"><b>t
