      is how Matilda Riley (1983) described the growing number of on-going
      family and marriage relationships that may not be active at the moment but
      carry potential for activation. Growth is due to longevity&#151;the longer
      people live, the more chance for relationship change&#151;as well as to
      the increased incidence of divorce and remarriage.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Ex-spouses&#146; relationship,
      and a myriad of in-law relationships, may be active during years of
      childrearing but become latent when graduations and weddings of children
      are concluded. The latency period may be marked by occasional contact or
      by none at all. The relationship does not end, however; it has potential
      for renewed contact. Such contact may come with age-related decisions
      about retirement or with invitations for contact by younger generations.</b></font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#996633"><b>Developing communication
      technology such as e-mail and Internet family webpages may also promote
      reactivation of latent relationships. Such technology may extend a further
      reach than past generations&#146; in-person family reunions. Thus, even
      ex-in-law connections are more likely than ever before to be made.</b></font></p>
