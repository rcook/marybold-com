      <p align="left"><b><font color="#996633">Blended ethnicity within a family
      is a way to refer to members of various skin pigment, various ethnic
      background, various national heritage, and so forth. In parts of American
      society, &#147;racial identifiers&#148; are requested on forms of all
      kinds: applications, school records, surveys. Even when labeled as
      optional, such identifiers may carry powerful messages. For many, the
      choices of </font></b><b><font color="#996633"> &#147;races&#148; printed
      on forms are not relevant or do not match their self-identity. Some
      children, for example, struggle with a form&#146;s implied requirement to
      choose between mother&#146;s identifier and father&#146;s.&nbsp;</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#996633">Even the use of the word &#147;race&#148;
      is problematic. The term </font></b><b><font color="#996633">
      has little meaning in the biological sciences. The variation of
      individuals within a specified </font></b><b><font color="#996633">&#147;race&#148;
      is greater than the difference between </font></b><b><font color="#996633">&#147;race
      A&#148; and &#147;race B.&#148; In everyday society the word is often used
      to refer to ethnicity or national heritage. Replacing it with </font></b><b><font color="#996633">&#147;ethnicity&#148;
      makes sense.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#996633">In the family field, many
      researchers continue to identify &#147;race&#148; in research questions
      and in sampling. Frequently, the effect is that &#147;race&#148; is a
      proxy for SES. Research is strengthened when proxy words are not used.
      Ethnicity may be important to research, of course. When it is, it should
      be identified with considered choice of words that may or may not include
      the word </font></b><b><font color="#996633"> &#147;race.&#148;</font></b></p>
