        Analyze your needs, strengths, and weaknesses and then choose the path
        of collaboration or solitary writing. Don't turn this decision into an
        excuse to not write &quot;yet&quot;; try writing solo and try writing

      Go ahead and set an aggressive schedule. Submitting one article or query
      letter a month is fine to do. (You'll know in short order if you need to
      slow down.) To ease the burden, submit a mix of short pieces and long, a
      mix of research reports and book reviews, a mix of essays and lit reviews.

      <td width="70%" valign="top">Submit to quality publications. That doesn't
        mean that every journal is blind, peer-reviewed. Some fine publications
        are editor-run. You can afford to have both styles in your list of
        publications.
        <p>Similarly, you can afford to have both national and regional journals
        in the list. Are national journals &quot;worth more&quot; at tenure
        review time? Of course, but everyone understands the competition for
        getting into those journals. A mix of regional and smaller journals is
        expected to round out your C.V.</p>
        <p>Must all your publications be scholarly literature? Depending on your
        field, you may find surprising tolerance for publishing in lay
        periodicals as well as lay books. One good way to justify publishing a
        &quot;lay&quot; piece occasionally is to say, &quot;I needed the income
        to supplement my academic salary.&quot;</td>
