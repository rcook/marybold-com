        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#333333">Across the 1990s, family scholars became
          increasingly reluctant to define &quot;family.&quot; Definitions based
          on family structure were no longer accurate as structure itself became
          more complex, especially with blended families due to remarriage.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Legal definitions also became more fluid.
          Blood relations were no longer cited as requirement although blood
          ties have continued to dictate in certain judicial areas, such as
          custody of children.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Although most printed forms continue to
          stress &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;guardian&quot; as terms to define
          a child's family, some schools (and orthodontist offices!) have
          included space on forms to list everyone the child spends time with.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300"><b>The following information is not typically
          shared with students in the classroom:</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">The term &quot;family&quot; is almost never
          restricted to &quot;adult(s) + child&quot; in scholarly literature.
          Today's family scholar is likely to consider all these constellations
          an example of family: two adults cohabiting, adults living with
          children, adults living without children, an adult living with a pet,
          adults living apart but who consider themselves a collective family,
          etc.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">A change in institutional views of family has
          been evident in large corporations, as well. &quot;Marital
          relations&quot; has been broadened to include commitment by two
          individuals, with employment benefits often the subject for
          corporations' definitions of beneficiary and dependent. Cohabitation
          and long-term commitment have thus sometimes substituted for marital
          status on &quot;official&quot; forms.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">The short answer to &quot;What is
          family?&quot; today has become &quot;Whatever you mean it to be.&quot;
          The strongest complaint against such a loose definition has come from
          conservative theorists who maintain that the structure or composition
          of family predicts family functioning.</font></p>
