        &#160;Sexual Abuse</font></b>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#333333">As historical forces go, sexuality education
          of any type is very new. University coursework in human sexuality was
          brand new in 1960 (Powell &amp; Cassidy, 2001) and continues to be an
          elective for most college majors (including many education majors,
          which implies that the subject is not viewed as an essential part of
          the study of child development).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Sexual abuse is commonly categorized under
          &quot;sexual health&quot; as a sub-part of sexuality education
          (SIECUS, 1996). Only since the 1980s has sexual abuse been a focus of
          prevention programs.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300"><b>The following information is not typically
          shared with students in the classroom:</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">The 1980s introduced many sexual abuse
          prevention programs, but outcomes continue to be debated (Powell &amp;
          Cassidy, 2001). Evaluators have been concerned that abuse is
          highlighted with little balance by other sexuality topics. Thus, the
          messages presented in classrooms are almost entirely negative and may
          create fear. For some students, fear of abuse may influence their
          interactions with friends and families and essentially reduce healthy
          expressions of affection. Even when interaction is not influenced, the
          negative images and concepts created in the classroom may affect
          students' thinking about their own sexuality, either at the time of
          the education effort or in the future.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Little retrospective data is available to
          follow this line of inquiry. Since negative impact has not been
          documented it is a concern that rarely receives attention in curricula
          review. (An interesting question in any review is to ask, &quot;What
          is missing?&quot; Obviously, it is a difficult question to answer!)</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">While sexuality educators cannot weigh
          negative impact of short-term abuse programs, they do report that many
          instances of sexual abuse have been reported and investigated as a
          result of classroom programs. Because of this outcome, abuse has
          continued to be included in sexuality curricula. An honest appraisal
          of other reasons for inclusion might acknowledge that abuse (what's
          wrong) is easier for adults to talk about than sexual expression
          (what's right).&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">When sexual abuse is presented as a
          preventive topic,&nbsp; programs tend to focus on the most serious
          forms of abuse. These forms have the highest consensus among
          communities as being unacceptable sexual behaviors (statutory rape,
          adult fondling a child, penetration of a child by an adult,
          pornography created with child models, and so forth). Less popular
          topics are pornography depicting adults (standards vary, and what one
          sexuality educator labels abusive, another might label harmless) and
          consensual relations between minors. These topics present &quot;gray
          areas&quot; for both educators and audiences.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">The tendency to avoid &quot;gray areas&quot;
          may increase the impact of the abuse topic that is presented in the
          classroom. The impact may be increased in two ways. First, the
          educator may inadvertently escalate the concern for abuse (&quot;I may
          not be comfortable about other sexuality topics, but this I'm sure of
          ... I'll make this hard-hitting.&quot;) Second, the presentation of
          only the most abusive behaviors denies that most behaviors (and the
          people exhibiting them) exist along a continuum. Instead, the
          presentation implies that a sexual behavior is either all bad or all
          good, a dichotomy hard to defend in any discussion of human behavior.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Designing and delivering a curriculum that
          somehow solves these problems may not be possible. A wiser approach is
          to invite educators to explore the questions on a personal basis.
          Assuming the educator's motive is one of helpfulness, that educator
          may be the best judge of what information is needed most by a
          particular group of students in a classroom. The following questions
          for the educator may assist.</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">1. Am I prepared to hear a student's plea
            for help in confronting an abusive situation?&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">2. Assuming that my &quot;openness&quot; to
            hearing a plea is discerned by students, what message am I currently
            sending? Do I need to change it?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">3. Do I consider sexual abuse a behavior
            that condemns the victim to a troubled future? (There is no right or
            wrong answer; therapists who work with victims vary in their
            conclusions about this.) Is my attitude obvious in how I speak about
            abuse? Should it be?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">4. Do I emphasize clear-cut anti-social
            sexual behavior because I prefer to keep the discussion off the
            &quot;gray areas&quot; that cause me discomfort?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">5. Do I emphasize my rehearsed lecture
            points and discourage questions/discussion from students?&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">6. Do I know what to say if a student
            blurts out a story about abuse in front of other students? Do I know
            what to say if it is said privately to me?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">7. Do I have a public and private response
            ready for other sensitive topics?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">8. Am I emotionally prepared to hear
            students' opinions or concerns about homosexuality, premarital
            sexual relations (encompassing a wide range of behaviors, not just
            intercourse), birth control technology, access to birth control
            technology, masturbation, communication about sexuality topics with
            parents, communication about sexuality topics with romantic partners
            as well as casual partners, date rape, STDs, and similar topics?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">9. Am I prepared to interact with students
            on any of these issues while also balancing comments that may be
            made by other adults in the classroom?</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">10. Do I know how to control a discussion
            (public or private) that risks violating classroom standards, scope
            of approved curriculum, as well as students' and my own privacy?</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Much of the PEPS curriculum is based on the
          traditional &quot;worst abuse&quot; topics. Because of school
          districts' constraints (as well as those dictated by communities),
          this emphasis in not likely to change. In other words, sexual abuse
          will probably never be taught by PEPS as a component of a more general
          sexuality curriculum. Our topic will likely continue to be placed in
          &quot;worst abuse&quot; categories.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Nevertheless, PEPS has an impact on sexuality
          issues. This is so simply because sexuality is a prevalent theme for
          most adolescents. Even when non-abuse sexuality topics are absent from
          the curriculum, they constitute a current running beneath the abuse
          topic. Alert educators realize that the sexual abuse topic is being
          received by students very much influenced by that underlying current.
          Consequently, the tenor of the abuse topic will be tied&#151;positively or
          negatively&#151;to the unspoken topics.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">As a stand-alone abuse topic, sexual abuse in
          PEPS risks the negative outcomes listed at the start of this page.
          Educators can lessen those outcomes by assessing their own
          &quot;agendas&quot; on the sexuality education front. Then, positive
          outcomes are more likely:</font></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">making a report of abuse</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">understanding that the perpetrator is
            responsible</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">understanding that the victim is not
            responsible</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">learning that help is available</font></p>
            <p><font color="#CC3300">learning skills that promote resiliency or
            recovery<a name="moreinfo"></a></font></p>
