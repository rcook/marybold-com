          </font></b></font><font face="Arial">The Parenting Center's policies guide PEPS Educators
          in terms of responsibility to represent TPC standards and mission.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">The curriculum guides PEPS Educators in terms of approved material
          for presentation in the public school classroom.</font> </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial">Typical questions and comments from students are presented with
            suggested responses. These responses serve as examples of &quot;tone
            and tenor&quot; that PEPS Educators should adopt in answering other
            concerns.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The curriculum also presents information that is typically <i>not</i>
            shared with students. While PEPS Educators are not
            &quot;censored,&quot; this guidance helps delineate subject areas
            that are historically avoided not just by PEPS, but by all guest
            speakers in the public school systems. Because public schools are
            sensitive to parental and community disapproval of discussion of
            &quot;controversial&quot; topics, the ISDs have been reluctant to
            endorse certain curricula, especially those addressing sexuality.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Discussion of condoms, consensual sexual relations, and
            homosexuality causes the most reaction among parents and community.
            PEPS Educators do not initiate such discussions. However, when
            students ask questions about these topics, the PEPS Educator may
            choose to address them. This is a judgment call that must take into
            account the group dynamic of the individual classroom.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The PEPS Educator is always able to say, &quot;That's not in my
            curriculum and I cannot speak to it knowledgably. I will discuss
            with your teacher where you can find that information.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Even when the PEPS Educator decides the topic needs to be
            addressed, a tone of open-mindedness and calm should be used. A good
            self-discipline technique: imagine that the school principal, a
            grandmother, and a minister are sitting at the back of the room.
            Make remarks that those people would consider respectful.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Cutting short a discussion can be handled tactfully with a
            comment such as, &quot;Thank you for exploring that so maturely. We
            cannot solve the larger issue and we have to move on with the
            material before us. But I respect your ability to discuss the
            issue.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Classroom teachers have reported that
            follow-up discussions have explored issues that arose in PEPS. For
            sensitive issues, this is a good outcome: the classroom teacher
            knows the climate and culture of the individual school and community
            and can likely address the issue more bluntly than the PEPS
            Educator.&nbsp;</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial">The PEPS Coordinator assists PEPS Educators in preparing to respond
          to a variety of potential student comments. Preparation is especially
          needed in order to feel comfortable and confident in hearing students'
          reports of abuse.</font> </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><font face="Arial">Sexual abuse is sometimes reported by students after the issue is
            explored in the PEPS classroom. TPC protocol for responding to a
            report is to offer to &quot;find help&quot; for the student. This
            should include immediate notification to the PEPS Coordinator. It
            may also include immediate report to the school counselor.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">PEPS Educators do not promote reporting abuse
            to the Educators, but the curriculum may provoke it. This is an
            important distinction, since PEPS is an education program. At no
            time do PEPS Educators present themselves as counselors.</font></p>
