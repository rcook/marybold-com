          <p><font face="Arial"><b>The Program</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">As a program of The Parenting Center, PEPS extends the goal of
          prevention of child abuse and neglect to the community of adolescents.
          Although some of the adolescents addressed by PEPS are parents
          themselves, most are not. In fact, most of this audience will not take
          on parenting roles for five or more years. The challenge of delivering
          a preventive curriculum such as PEPS is that it does not occur at the
          recipient's &quot;teachable moment,&quot; or the time of highest
          interest in the topic.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Yet adolescents are interested in many of the aspects of family
          life that can be associated with child abuse. PEPS seeks to tap those
          interests through curriculum and classroom delivery well-suited to the
          adolescents. While some abuse topics are addressed directly, others
          are presented indirectly. For example, sexual abuse is discussed in
          frank and open terms on an adult level. Physical abuse is addressed
          indirectly: discussion centers on how families handle stress, anxiety,
          and expectations of children's behavior. In some classrooms, students
          will move that discussion to the question of physical abuse. In
          others, physical abuse may be mentioned only briefly but the elements
          that frequently trigger abuse will have been covered thoroughly.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Much of this approach falls under the category of
          family
          strengths model (Dunst, 1995). While The Parenting Center's
          focus is firmly rooted in prevention, and it's practice includes
          intervention, the goal is sometimes best reached through a strengths
          model. In programs such as PEPS, a strengths model supports growth
          toward family life that never includes abuse.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">The benefits of a family strengths model are
          tremendous (Bold, 2001).</font>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Arial">People find their own philosophy about
              family.</font>
            <li><font face="Arial">People gain confidence in their ability to
              solve problems.</font>
            <li><font face="Arial">People learn how to ask for help when they
              need it.</font>
            <li><font face="Arial">People feel good about family and know how to
              strive for a happy one.&nbsp;</font></li>
          </ul>
          <font face="Arial">This model supports &quot;parents in their own
          growth as competent, caring people who can translate their philosophy
          and knowledge of family to future needs as they arise&quot; (Bold,
          2001). PEPS seeks to support adolescents in similar growth
          that will eventually influence how they maintain their own families in
          adulthood.</font>
          <p><font face="Arial">While PEPS does not elicit reports of abuse by
          students, the presentation of material does often provoke adolescents'
          decisions to seek help concerning abuse. Typically, this decision is
          made by a female student who decides to tell someone (the PEPS
          Educator, the classroom teacher, or the school counselor)&nbsp; about
          sexual abuse she has experienced. In cases such as this, PEPS has
          effectively served as an intervention program. Because of this, PEPS
          Educators are trained in responding to reports of abuse.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>Administration of PEPS</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">PEPS is administered by a Coordinator based in
          the Forth Worth office of The Parenting Center.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>PEPS Educators</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">The PEPS curriculum is delivered by Educators
          trained and evaluated by the Coordinator.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>The PEPS Curriculum</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">As detailed within this training site, the PEPS
          curriculum is a research-based program that addresses adolescents in a
          developmentally appropriate manner. Content knowledge reflects
          accepted standards in the field of family life education as well as
          the values and mission of The Parenting Center. Topics are relevant to
          most adolescents and answer the information needs of
          adolescents.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Methods of curriculum delivery allow the PEPS
          Educator to serve as a facilitator of the group rather than as a
          lecturer. Although the PEPS Educator does sometimes impart information
          directly, indirect information delivery is the usual method. The
          theoretical foundation for the PEPS curriculum delivery is cognitive
          field interaction theory, with emphasis on exploratory-understanding
          learning. Strategies are employed to enhance knowledge
          transfer and to accommodate differing learning
          styles.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Certain aspects of the curriculum are based on
          results of focus groups conducted by The Parenting Center in 2001.
          Groups of PEPS educators (both paid employees and volunteers) and
          professionals from The Parenting Center were interviewed by an
          independent researcher. Comments from the focus groups guided the
          writing of this curriculum.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Classroom Health teachers familiar
          with the PEPS program were surveyed by the same researcher. Themes
          emerged from the survey that supported many of the needs identified by
          The Parenting Center.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">The curriculum also reflects many of the
          elements of PEPS curricula from previous years. While data from the
          earliest programs (dating to 1980) are no longer current, basic
          precepts of PEPS have been retained or updated in order to maintain
          the historical reputation of the program in the community.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>The Audience</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">PEPS is taught across two large school districts
          in the DFW Metroplex: Fort Worth Independent School District and
          Arlington Independent School District.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Ages of students range from 14 to 19. Grades
          range from 9 to 12; in most schools today, the majority of Health
          students are in grades 9 and 10.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>Evaluation of the program</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Evaluation of the program is accomplished
          through mixed methods:</font></p>
