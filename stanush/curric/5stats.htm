          <p><font color="#CC3300"><b>The following information is not typically
          shared with students in the classroom:</b></font></p>
          </font><font face="Arial">
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Grubin and Wingate (1996) warn that
          statistics on sex abuse, especially, may be unreliable. Many abuses go
          unreported. Some reports go uninvestigated.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Across the 1990s, reports of sex abuse
          decreased, but researchers do not conclude that there was less
          activity. That is not known. It is possible that reports have gone
          down as litigation for false accusations have gone up. Or it is
          possible that sex crimes decreased across the nation just as all
          crimes decreased in most cities during the 1990s. (U.S. government
          statistics showed a decline in physical abuse, also, in the late
          1990s.)</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Some therapists rely on a statistic that a
          sex offender has as many as 50 victims in his lifetime. But statistics
          on recidivism (re-arrest) are not so clear. As Grubin and Wingate
          (1996) report, the recidivism rate ranges from about 20% (non-violent)
          to 30% (rapists) for sex offenders. However, caveats are usually
          offered about such statistics: perhaps the sex offender has had
          multiple victims before being arrested, perhaps the offender learns
          how to avoid detection following a single arrest, perhaps law
          enforcement records are not well enough coordinated to reflect the
          number of offenders who move to a new location following a first
          arrest.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">In short, as we have learned more about sex
          offenders in the past decade, our statistical information has not
          necessarily become any more reliable.</font></p>
