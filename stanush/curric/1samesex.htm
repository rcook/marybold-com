        &#160;Same Sex Partners</font></b>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#333333">Recognition of same-sex partners raising
          children is new. Just in the past couple of decades have same-sex
          parents made their sexual orientation known as they raised children in
          their homes.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Families with same-sex partners face
          challenges in this society, and sometimes the children face special
          challenge from peers at school. In spite of these difficulties,
          research on the children's development has come in with one major
          observation: these kids are developing normally (Stacy, 1998).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We can count on kids being kids, regardless
          of their parents' sexual orientation. Families with kids go to
          MacDonald's, and the soccer field, and G-rated movies. There's a span
          of years, there, when family focus just isn't on parents. It's on kid
          activities.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Too, the children in these families do not
          adopt a sexual orientation based on their parents' model. The rate of
          homosexual lifestyle is the same for children from every other kind of
          family. This is interesting, because we have wondered for a long time
          now about how important &quot;gender models&quot; are to young
          children, and to older children, too.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">The one research view that finds a difference
          is that children from same-sex-parent homes may be quicker to help
          classmates stand up to school bullies. That research result may
          reflect just some kids in one town, so we're wise not to assume that
          it describes all children in same-sex-parent homes. But we can imagine
          that these children may indeed learn empathy at an early age since
          they may be the target of discrimination themselves.</font></p>
          <p><b><font color="#CC3300">The following information is not typically
          shared with students in the classroom:</font></b></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">It is possible that the research on normal
          development of children in same-sex-parent homes is a reflection of a
          &quot;cream of the crop&quot; set of parents. Homosexuals deciding to
          openly parent today find barriers that they must first commit to
          facing and then commit to overcoming. Thus, the decision to parent is
          a serious one that is likely to be made only after considerable
          soul-searching. The current apparent health of same-sex-parent
          families may reflect superior parenting commitment and skills on the
          part of a relatively small group of people.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Too, the normal development of boys in homes
          without males in residence may be a function of having &quot;cream of
          the crop&quot; moms. Lesbians committed to parenting a son well may be
          taking extra effort to include men in their son's life. So, just
          because a man does not live with the boy does not mean that the boy is
          not in frequent contact with men.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">If acceptance of same-sex parenting continues
          to grow, the population of same-sex parents will surely grow in number
          and become more diverse. We may see mediocre and poor parents in the
          next generation, which may result in child profiles that are not as
          positive as today's.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Research into lesbian parents' fears (Hare,
          1994; Siegenthaler, 1999) reveal that highest on the list is that
          their children may be ostracized at school or in some way
          discriminated against or embarrassed. Lesbian parents overwhelmingly
          give credit to their families of origin for supporting their parenting
          efforts.</font></p>
