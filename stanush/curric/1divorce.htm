        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#333333">Divorce in America has been
          &quot;relatively&quot; stable since 1980. The steep increase in the
          divorce rate occurred between 1965 and 1980. Those years were marked
          by three fast-spreading ideas:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font color="#333333">women can accomplish birth control with
              98% effectiveness (following the introduction of &quot;the
              pill&quot; in 1964)</font></li>
            <li><font color="#333333">divorce can be mutual and non-shaming
              (following the introduction of &quot;no-fault divorce&quot; in
              1969)</font></li>
            <li><font color="#333333">wives can ease family financial burdens by
              entering the paid work force (following the oil crunch and related
              economic factors in the 1970s)</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font color="#333333">While no single event made divorce more
          accepted in American society, the cumulative effect of these and other
          societal conditions changed how Americans viewed divorce. In
          retrospect, the woman's movement can be seen to have crested in the
          1970s and, in fact, that decade is now referred to as the second wave
          of feminism. (The first wave was early in the 20th century and is
          marked by the 1920 passage of women's right to vote, although efforts
          leading to that change began in the mid-1850s.)</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Since 1980, other demographic changes have
          &quot;shored up&quot; the liberal attitude toward divorce. For
          example, the median marrying ages of both men and woman have increased
          steadily. Women's enrollment in college and graduate school has
          steadily increased (and in 1998 women started earning more than half
          of the country's Master's degrees) making them more independent
          economically and more competitive for high salaries in the job market.
          In the 1990s, especially, economic well-being produced what it usually
          does: more open attitudes toward others' lifestyles and more
          optimistic reports of our own lives.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Family demographics have also changed
          dramatically. Today, most children know someone who is divorced&#151;and it
          may be their own parent. These statistics offer perspective (Schertz,
          2001):</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>While the majority of individuals over the age of thirty grew-up
              in a &quot;traditional&quot; or nuclear family, 74% of
              today's households are single parent or blended families.</p></li>
            <li><p>Trends suggest that by about 2005, 50% of
              American families with children under the age of 18 will be blended
              families.</p></li>
            <li><p>80% of the children under the age of 15 will live some portion
              of their lives in either single parent or blended families.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Widespread occurrence of divorce and blended families serves
          to normalize divorce and to continue the high level of acceptance in
          today's society.</p>
          <p>The level of divorce is high compared to the rest of the world.
          This prompts an important question: could the U.S. really have changed
          so much in such a short period of time that the nation would be so
          very different from other countries? Taking a look at the divorce
          question from a historical perspective forces us to admit that the
          sudden rise in divorce may not have been so sudden, after all.</p>
          <p>Historically, Americans have always tolerated separation and short
          marriages. To start with, consider the average length of marriage in
          colonial America: about a dozen years (Coontz, 1992). &quot;You grew
          up, got married, had some kids, and you died.&quot; Even by 1900, life
          expectancy was a short 47 years. With the median marrying age for men
          at that time being 26, the length of marriage was not even double that
          of colonial times.</p>
          <p>What is not well known is that Americans had a relatively high
          divorce rate in the &quot;olden days&quot; when compared to the rest
          of the world. And it had an even higher desertion rate (Riley, 1991). Ending a marriage was easily done: a husband (typically, it
          was the male spouse) simply packed up and left. By moving to a new
          territory, he could start over, perhaps even marry again, without ever
          legally divorcing his wife and without providing for support of any
          children left behind. Abandoned wives frequently posted public notices
          about their missing husbands, to little effect.</p>
          <p>Is desertion/separation/divorce an American tradition? Some
          historians believe that is the case (Riley, 1991). Outside of Native
          American populations, early Americans are described variously as
          adventuresome, risk-taking, pioneer, individualistic, rebellious, and
          even criminal. Early America was not founded by rule followers.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300"><b>The following information is not typically
          shared with students in the classroom:</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Researchers in the family field debate the
          &quot;true&quot; question of divorce and its effect on children. One
          side, sometimes referred to as the &quot;decline theory
          orientation,&quot; maintains that divorce reflects the increasingly
          self-centered and short-sighted nature of adults. In short, such
          theorists believe the family is &quot;in decline&quot; and suffering
          due to changes in family structure. The wide acceptance of single
          parenthood is the root of the problem, regardless of whether the
          single status is the result of divorce or of never having married.
          While theorists in this camp usually call for a return to two-parent
          homes, this is almost always in reference to two biological or
          adoptive parents (the &quot;original&quot; parents) and not dual
          parenting that arises from re-marriage.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">The other side of the debate is sometimes
          referred to as &quot;normative-adaptive.&quot; Theorists in this camp
          consider divorce a societal convention that reflects economic and
          lifestyle trends. In terms of effects of divorce, these theorists
          insist that the health of the family depends on how the people in it
          are getting along, not the number or structure of family membership. In other
          words, poor functioning on the part of a child whose parents are
          divorced actually is tied to the family functioning years before the
          divorce took place. For children in high-conflict homes, the divorce
          may even be a positive resolution.</font></p>
