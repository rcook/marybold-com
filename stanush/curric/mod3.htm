          <p><font face="Arial">How are people getting along in a family? We call that the family
          dynamic and it can sometimes be summed up in two words: communication
          and anxiety. If the family handles these, then the dynamic is probably
          pretty healthy. (Never perfect!) But we can't write a recipe for
          family dynamic. People are different! What works in my family might
          not be right for your family. We can see that clearly just comparing
          families' communication styles.</p>

          <p><b><a name="Family Communication"><font color="#CC3300" face="Arial">Family
          Communication</font></a></b></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">What's normal family communication? How much
        talking should a family be doing every day? I have no idea! Some of the
        first research that used videotape of families in their own homes was
        conducted by Ray Birdwhistell back in the 1960s and 1970s. One of his
        studies looked at families in different settings in Pennsylvania. He
        found a huge range in communication time among healthy families: from
        just 2&#189; minutes a day all the way up to 12 hours a day.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">That's a huge range! Sometimes family
        communication changes drastically when kids grow to a new stage. So,
        what was usual when the kids were little may be different when the kids
        are big. And talking time changes with the seasons, and with school
        schedules.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CC3300"><b><font face="Arial">[Option:</b></font><font color="#333333">
        Can you tell me what's a normal amount of talking in your family? I
        imagine we'll find a range of talking time just in this room. </font><font color="#CC3300">Discussion
        may produce comments about sibling relations, decreased
        contact with parents, and busy
        schedules.<b>]</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">A goal for family communication probably
        shouldn't focus so much on &quot;how many minutes a day&quot; as on &quot;how open is it?&quot; I want my kids to be able to talk to me when
        they need to or want to. And I want to be able to talk when <i>I</i>
        need or want to. So, when I say &quot;open communication&quot; in my
        house, I really mean &quot;available for communication.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">I can tell you where &quot;available&quot;
        worked best for us. The kitchen, and I don't necessarily mean family
        meals because there were plenty of years that we weren't all home at
        supper time.<a name="3vacation"></a> </font></p>
        <p><b><font color="#CC3300"><font face="Arial">[Option:</font></b><font color="#333333">
        What places work for you and your family? </font><font color="#CC3300">Discussion
        may produce comments about conversation in the car, </font><a style="text-decoration:none" href="3vacation.htm">on family
        vacation</a><font color="#CC3300">,
        around the pool, and so forth.<b>]</b></font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Regardless of the time and the place, family
        communication should be available to everyone in the family. When you
        need to talk, you need to believe there's someone who's going to listen.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">What about fighting? Again, there's a huge
        range: the loud family who thinks Thanksgiving just isn't Thanksgiving
        without a good fight &#133; and the quiet family where no one raises a voice,
        ever. Even the very quiet family has its fights. They just do it in
        another style.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">What's fair in family fights? Should children
        never see their parents argue? Families are so different, that we don't
        want to write a recipe of &quot;Just This Much Anger Is Allowed.&quot;
        One rule of thumb is to look at how the kids are handling it. If the
        kids are worried, then the parents are probably fussing too much. If the
        kids are taking things in stride, and if they see their parents settling
        an argument as well as starting one, then there's probably an OK level
        of fighting going on.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Conflict is a normal part of life. And anytime
        two or more people live together, there's going to be conflict! Conflict
        is inevitable for families. We all react differently to conflict. But most
        of us feel some anxiety when conflict arises.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">This is a potato. And it represents anxiety.
        Most of us have a hard time defining anxiety, but we know it when we
        feel it.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Anxiety is different from stress. Stress is
        something from the outside pressuring me. I can identify a stressor
        pretty well, even if I can't always eliminate it. Finals week brings
        pressure and stress. You can't eliminate that stress, but you can decide
        how to handle it.&nbsp; </font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">And anxiety is different from fear. When I have
        a fear, I know what's scaring me. I can point to it, or describe it.
        Sometimes, I can even decide to handle it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Anxiety is different. I cannot point to it. I
        cannot name it or describe it. But I know it when I feel it. And a lot of
        people have a hard time handling it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">So, that's where the potato comes in. I imagine
        that it's a &quot;hot&quot; potato and it does a fair job of symbolizing
        anxiety. It's hot so I feel jumpy when I hold it. In fact, it's so hot
        that I act &#151; I throw it off every chance I get. And that gets us to
        a fact about anxiety: it travels through a group.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Ever been in a room of babies and toddlers? If
        one starts crying, a chain reaction begins. &quot;Hey, that baby must know
        that something's wrong. I'm going to cry, too!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">At a workplace, anxiety can travel in a day's
        time, sometimes just on a rumor that a change may be coming.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">And in a high school, anxiety can sweep through
        in a matter of hours. And it doesn't have to be finals week!</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Let's see how anxiety can travel around this
        room. I'll start tossing anxiety to this one person and let's watch as
        the &quot;hot&quot; potatoes move down every row of this room.</font></p>
          <p><img border="0" src="../images/potato.jpg" alt="potatoes made of foam" width="210" height="158"> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<img border="0" src="../images/holdpota.jpg" width="210" height="158"></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#CC3300"><b>[</b>Start handing the
        props slowly with the
        first one or two potatoes, then hand off potatoes more quickly to the
        starter person. By the time the last potato is handed off, start making
        anxious announcements:</font><font color="#333333"> Faster, faster. That
        potato's too hot to hold. Get them moving. Hurry. More are coming. And
        they'll start coming around again in just a minute. Faster, faster. </font><font color="#CC3300">Allow
        the potatoes to circulate for a couple of minutes. At some point, people
        will start throwing them. Allow that for a bit, too.<b>]</b></font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">OK. Let's try to contain the anxiety, now. Just
        gather them together back there for me.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Lowering anxiety is much harder because our
        instinct is to &quot;pass it off.&quot; Feel bad? Make the next person
        feel bad, too. You've heard the expression &quot;kick the dog&quot;?
        That's anxiety talking.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">The problem is, you can't really pass it off
        and feel better. Because it's going to come around again!</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">And if you're in a group passing anxiety, maybe
        a family upset about a problem, the anxiety is guaranteed to return. For
        the group, that's bad, too. Because as long as everyone is anxious,
        they're not going to be very good problem-solvers.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">So. How to lower anxiety. If I can lower it,
        then I can attack the real problem. If my anxiety rules, then I'm never
        going to solve my problems.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Lowering anxiety takes awareness. You have to figure out whether you're dealing with stress, or fear, or anxiety. But
        as I said earlier, most of us recognize anxiety, even if we can't
        describe it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Lowering anxiety takes patience and practice.
        It takes time and it may not work very well the first few times you try
        it.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">There's not a single perfect way to reduce
        anxiety. Some people just calm themselves with self-talk. Some people
        meditate. Some people go clean the bathtub. I imagine myself holding a
        hot potato that I want desperately to hand off to someone else, but
        instead I start lowering it in my hands. It's still hot, but I hold it
        gently and slowly lower it as it cools off.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Therapists tell us that, with practice, people
        can lower their own anxiety in a matter of minutes (Jennings, 1999).
        Most people can do that in 4 to 10 minutes. Now, not everyone will fit
        in that window. I'm married to a man who can lower his anxiety in about
        45 seconds. It's great to live with someone like that! But a friend of
        mine takes about 45 minutes. She has to talk to herself to sort things out.
        Her anxiety drops very slowly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#CC3300"><b>[Option:</b></font><font color="#333333">
        Does anyone here know how you handle your anxiety or how long it takes? </font><font color="#CC3300">Discussion
        may include comments such as: I cry, I have to talk to someone, I clean
        the house, I go exercise for an hour, I just feel bad for hours. Females
        may be more forthcoming with examples than males.<b>]</b></font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Recognizing anxiety, and knowing how long it
        takes you to lower it, is important self-knowledge. Not only can you
        help the process by reminding yourself that you know the anxiety will
        lessen, but you can also help lower the <i>group</i> anxiety.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Now, this doesn't mean you have to be
        responsible for everyone else's anxiety, but if you are in a group where
        anxiety is being passed around, it may be in your best interest to help
        lower the group's level of anxiety.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">If you can first lower your own anxiety (in the
        4 to 10 minutes), and then if you can <i>maintain</i> that for another 8
        to 16 minutes, the group will respond. That seems to be about the amount
        of time it takes for a group to notice that things are different. So,
        the whole process could easily take 15 to 25 minutes, but then the group
        will be better able to solve the real problem, instead of just throwing
        around the anxiety about the problem.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">There's no guarantee your group will do this in
        8 to 16 minutes. A really dysfunctional group could take <i>hours.</i> I
        don't know if I could stay in that setting that long, waiting!</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">This may be something you can try. I hope it
        works for you.</font></p>
