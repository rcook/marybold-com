          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">A basic issue for any family is how they
          handle change. The greatest challenge for families is the entry or
          exit of family members.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">An entry could be a baby being born. Sounds
          like a happy event &#151; but it's one of the most stressful events for a
          family. An exit might be a death, sudden or expected. It might be a
          graduation that makes someone move away from the family home.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Other changes? Maybe it's a single parent's
          romantic partner. Maybe it's a grandparent moving in. What else?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">How a family reacts to change may
        tell us how they handle stress of all kinds.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"> Those of you who are headed to
        business school will study innovation models applied to corporations
        undergoing change.&nbsp;Change can be tracked in terms of acceptance and
        resistance cycles (McFarland, Senn, &amp; Childress, 1994).&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">In the model here, we look for
        what makes the difference between how people react to change. Basically,
        an increase of information reduces resistance
        and channels energy to the change cycle.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Think about a business example:
        it's time to break up the corporation into
        smaller units. Does management make all the decisions and announce on a
        Friday that on Monday morning all employees will report to new offices in
        different buildings around town? Experience has shown that
        the employees will not respond well. They won't be great employees and
        the company may actually lose a lot of money while the workers make a
        slow adjustment to the changes.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">That's why so many businesses today share
        information freely with their employees. Change is announced far in
        advance so that employees can make suggestions and be part of the
        change-over. If the workers help plan the change, they are not as
        resistant to it.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Let's apply this to families. If
          a change is coming, maybe the accordion effect of step-siblings coming
          and going during summer vacation, the more information everyone has,
          the better. And the more the kids are invited to participate in
          planning, the better. So, we can sum up the change model in two words:
          communication and participation.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"> Obviously, all
          people don't respond to change in the same way.&nbsp;You may know
          someone with a personality that just doesn't tolerate change. Maybe no
          amount of information will help that person make a change. Maybe only
          a lot of adjustment time will help. But most of us do respond to the
          need to change as long as we are given lots of information and given
          the chance to participate in making the changes.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Family beliefs about change can
          be unique, just as individuals' beliefs are. The Green Family may
          think that change is great and maybe they move every 3 years just to
          have the variety of living many places. The Red Family may think that
          moving from the family home is a tragedy. For a military family,
          moving may be so routine they don't worry about the changes they have
          to make. We can't assume that families treat change the same way, just
          as we can't assume that individuals react to it the same way.</font></p>
