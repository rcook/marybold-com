        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">All of these words have meaning when we discuss
        emotional abuse: self-esteem, self-concept, nurturing, rejecting,
        ignoring.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">We use the words to help define emotional
        abuse, with the understanding that definitions are subjective. We
        started the week with a Census Bureau definition of family and saw that
        people define family much more broadly. Abuse is defined differently by
        different families, and it is viewed differently in different
        communities.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">So, our challenge is to find a description that
        can cross communities, cross cultures, and even cross families. This is
        harder to do with emotional abuse than with physical or sexual abuse. In
        those forms, abuse is more obvious: there are observable behaviors and
        consequences. Emotional abuse may be invisible to the outsider. It can
        even be invisible to the abuser!</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Emotional abuse attacks the victim's
        self-esteem or self-concept. Depending on the personality of the victim,
        the damage may be kept &quot;under wraps.&quot; Unfortunately, the
        damage is often long-term.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Let's put it in terms of a preschooler: the
        child believes everything big people say. If a parent says, &quot;You're
        stupid,&quot; the child does what? Yes, takes on that identification. I
        don't know what to do with the dog leash because I'm stupid. The child
        will make the next connection on his own: I don't know how to read
        because I'm stupid. I don't know how to make friends because I'm stupid.
        The connection can extend to every aspect of the child's life, and it
        can last all the rest of the child's life.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Was the child ever stupid to begin with?
        Probably not! Most likely, someone called the child stupid when the
        child was simply acting like a child. Little kids don't know how to do
        lots of things. They are ignorant of the workings of the world. They
        literally see the world differently than we do. If they have helpful
        guides, they'll learn everything they need to. If they have impatient or
        abusive guides, they'll shut down emotionally and <i>not</i> learn their
        way around the world.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Here's a sample of how a preschooler sees the
        world. If we pour 8 ounces of water into each of 2 containers, we know
        we have equal amounts of water. But the preschooler sees it differently:
        the tall glass must have more water because the water level is higher.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Even if we were to pour out the water and
        &quot;prove&quot; they were equal amounts, the child would still give
        the wrong answer when the liquids were poured back into the 2 different
        containers.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Eventually, the child is able to grasp that the
        volume is &quot;conserved&quot; regardless of shape. But at a young age,
        this is simply not understood.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#CC3300"><b>[Optional explanation:</b> This
        is the theory of conservation as explain by the Swiss child
        developmentalist, Jean Piaget. When similar &quot;conservation
        tasks&quot; are presented to children under the age of 6 or 7, the
        children are typically unable to make the correct choice. Piaget
        described their thinking as pre-operational. The next stage of thinking
        (operational) is entered by most children by age 7 and characterizes
        what most of us think of in terms of elementary school learning ability.
        Age 7 is also a typical time for children to grasp the concepts of time
        and money, abstractions that younger children may have in their
        vocabulary but without any real understanding.<b>]</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Young children cannot &quot;reason&quot; and
        figure out what's real and what's not. They live in something akin to a
        fantasy world. They may learn to say that something is
        &quot;pretend,&quot; but you'll notice they can't define that
        word!&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" color="#CC3300"><b>[Optional story:</b> In the
        early 1990s, researchers interviewed 4-year-olds on the east coast with
        a single question: &quot;Is Big Bird real?&quot; All the 4-year-olds
        answered &quot;Yes&quot; except for one little girl. She answered,
        &quot;No, Big Bird is not real. That is just a costume. Inside is a
        regular size bird.&quot;<b>]</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Barney lives, Cookie Monster eats cookies, and
        Pokemon characters have individual personalities. The fact that children
        &quot;believe&quot; what we put before them helps explain why they are
        so vulnerable to emotional abuse.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#333333">If a parent calls a child a name &#151; stupid or
        lazy or fool &#151; children believe it.
        The child will accept a label, whether it is good or bad. </font></font></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Rejecting</b> &#151; Name-calling is called &quot;rejecting.&quot;
        It also includes put-downs. I don't think any of us ever get old enough
        to not feel the sting of a rejection, but children are especially
        vulnerable. They don't know how to analyze the put-down and figure out
        that the other person is speaking out of anger.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Terrorizing</b> &#151; Another form of
        emotional abuse is
        &quot;terrorizing.&quot; Again, the child's inability to reason makes
        her vulnerable. If a big person says, &quot;Move one muscle and I'm
        going to break your fingers&quot; the child cannot sort out what may or
        may not happen.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Ignoring</b> &#151; This
        entails taking care of the child's physical needs but withholding
        affection, smiles, and other forms of nurturing. An example of this form
        of abuse is the parent who chooses to ignore the child's birthday. When
        the child sees other kids at school bringing cupcakes on their birthday,
        the child may ask, &quot;When is my birthday?&quot; The ignoring parent
        will reply, &quot;You don't have one.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Corrupting</b> &#151; Exposing
        a child to adult activities is abusive because the child has no way to
        process the information. This could mean exposing a child to
        pornography, or taking her to a drinking party, or including her in drug
        use. Of course, some of these involve physical risk, also. But even if
        they don't, they are emotionally abusive.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Isolating</b> &#151; Preventing
        a child from interacting with other children is called isolating. Even
        the child who lives in an apartment building can be &quot;socially
        isolated,&quot; with neighbors literally just a few feet away.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Nurturing children means meeting their needs
        according to their developmental level.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">For babies, the developmental needs are
        physical care, attachment to a responsive caregiver, and brain
        stimulation. There is a genuine mix of physical care and emotional care
        that takes place in infancy. From the baby's perspective, the mix of
        care means that he can trust that his needs will be met (Erikson, 1997).
        If the trust is there, we usually say that infant attachment is
        successful.</font> <font color="#333333" face="Arial">If babies don't attach to a &quot;significant
        other,&quot; they grow up to be pretty miserable people (Harris, 1998).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#333333">Just since the mid-1990s, we
        have come to understand that nurturing babies also means giving them
        mental stimulation. Brain stimulation promotes the &quot;best&quot;
        possible brain growth at crucial times in a human's life.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#333333"> We have just
        recently established that there's a window of opportunity in the first 3
        years of life to create the best brain environment for cognitive
        development (White, 2001).
        In fact, 95% of what we know in the field of brain research has been
        discovered just since 1995 (Conyers, 2000).</font></font></p>

          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Here's just a sampling of what we know.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">At birth, a baby has about 50
        trillion synapses or &quot;connections&quot; between brain cells. The
        number will multiply by about 20 times in the first 3 months of life.
        So, at 3 months of age, the baby has about 1,000 trillion.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">The number of synapses continues
        to grow if the child continues to be stimulated by the world around him.
        Every game of peek-a-boo, every baby book, every smile the baby receives
        &#151; these all give the infant brain something to respond to, and the
        response is literally growth of synapses.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Although we can keep learning
          our entire lives, and we certainly know that the physical structure of
          the brain continues to change, there are certain &quot;windows of
          time&quot; for best brain growth. We have been able to see the first 3
          years of life as such a window.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">We know that when we compare the
          number of synapses at 3 years with the number at adulthood, there is a
          big change: by adulthood, about half of the synapses have
          disappeared.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">&quot;Reduction of synapses&quot;
          is usually described as &quot;pruning.&quot; It is perfectly normal.
          The brain will not use all of the synapses that have been created, so
          it &quot;prunes&quot; the un-needed ones. What we would to be able to
          say is that all babies and preschoolers make so many synapses at the
          start, and stimulation is &quot;kept up&quot; so that the natural
          pruning that takes place does not work to the disadvantage of the
          child.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">We know that in cases of severe
          child abuse and neglect, not enough synapses are built in the first
          place. Then, when pruning takes place, the child may lose the
          potential ability to do something simply because she is not exercising
          particular brain cells in her young life.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Back to the topic of &quot;normal
        pruning.&quot; I like to quote Dr. Ron Fannin (2001), who is a
        developmentalist at Texas Woman's University. He likens the pruning of
        synapses to growing topiary at Disney World. The gardeners do just plant
        a bush and hope that it grows in the shape of Mickey Mouse ears. Rather,
        they grow a great, bushy bush &#151; and then prune selectively to
        create the desired shape.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Our brains are something like
        topiary! We produce many synapses and then prune away what is not needed
        or is not used.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Our new knowledge about infant
        brain development is paired with new knowledge of a special risk to
        infants: Shaken Baby Syndrome. You may have heard about this in the news
        or on a public service announcement. We're trying to get the word out to
        families about the real chance for brain damage or even death when a
        baby is shaken. Even &quot;tossing&quot; a baby in the air can cause
        brain damage; certainly, shaking a baby in anger is enough to cause
        damage. It is impossible to know how many children suffered brain injury
        as infants because they were shaken. It's something that they pay for
        the rest of their lives as they are unable to function as they would
        have.</font></p>
