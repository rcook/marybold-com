          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Thank you. I'll ask the parents to come up
          first. Welcome, Terry. You'll see from your card that you are
          &quot;sensitive to others' needs, but easily worried.&quot; And if
          Marcus will come forward, we will describe your Starbucks romance.
          Marcus is ultra-logical about everything, but had a passion for golf.
          When asked, he can listen patiently.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Terry was divorced 2 years ago when her
          ex-husband Tad called her one Friday night to announce that he and his
          secretary were in Kansas City and not coming back any time soon. Terry
          had not worked up to that point, but she quickly entered the work
          force in order to support herself and her kids.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Marcus is a widower. His wife Caroline died 4
          years ago in a car accident. He and his daughters grieved for several
          years but they have begun to move forward now.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Terry and Marcus met at a Starbucks. Both had
          been out shopping for groceries for their homes and stopped by
          Starbucks for a cappuccino. They chatted briefly at the counter while
          waiting for their orders.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">The next Friday evening, Terry and Marcus
        just happened to bump into each other at exactly the same time at
        Starbucks. After several such meetings, they decided to go out to dinner
        together, and from there the relationship grew.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">So, months later, they decide to marry. We
          will eavesdrop as they gather in their first family meeting to discuss
          the blending of the two families.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Terry, will you call your kids up to stand
          next to you? Their names are Tod, Tammy, and Timmy.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Tod is a talented guy. He plans to be a film
          director. But at 16 he's required to still be in high school and that
          frustrates him. He's heard the story of Steven Spielberg as a
          teenager. Spielberg walked out of high school one day and onto a movie
          lot. He took over an empty trailer and started holding meetings with
          writers and producers. It took 2 or 3 weeks for the movie studio to
          catch on that a teenager was on the lot. They kicked him out, and he
          had to go back to high school. Tod likes that story and he lives for
          his own exit from high school. His goal is to get to UCLA Film School.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Tammy is 13. She's an athlete. Plays on every
          team at her junior high. Very active, very assertive. Forget those
          things people say about middle children. Tammy is <i>not</i>
          overlooked, and certainly not quiet.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Timmy, you'll be sitting through this to keep
          you nice and short. Timmy's only 4 years old. He may not have a lot of
          skills yet, but he is an expert at Pokemon.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Marcus, will you please call your daughters
          forward?</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Martina-Gabriele is 17 and a senior in high
          school. She is an average student, but super-responsible. If she makes
          a commitment, she sticks to it. She was not happy to hear the news of
          her father dating Terry and she was surprised when he announced the
          marriage. But she will support her Dad, so she's going to try to get
          along with Terry.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Christine-Angelena is not so supportive. She
          is 9 and quite aware that with 4-year-old Timmy around, she has lost
          her status of &quot;baby of the family.&quot;</font></p>

        Negotiation of Bedrooms</a></b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Now, let's see how this blended family
          handles its first task: sorting out the bedrooms. Terry's house is
          larger than Marcus's, so they have decided to live there. There are 4
          bedrooms plus a small study that can be used as a bedroom. Let's
          eavesdrop as we listen to how this family sorts out the rooms. Terry
          and Marcus, how will you present this issue to the kids?</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300" face="Arial"><b>[</b>The family members negotiate the

          Audience, any comments for this group?</font></p>

          Scenario</a></b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Well, you handled that very well. Obviously,
          you need a tougher problem. Here's a scenario for parents, Tod,
          Christine-Angelena, and Timmy. Martina and Tammy, you can sit down for
          a while.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">OK. New scenario: Terry and Marcus are at
          work. It's after-school time. Tod is at the house because he is
          supposed to get home quickly every day to receive Christine-Angelena
          and Timmy. They are dropped off by a school bus.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Today, Tod has friends visiting. They are
          sitting out on the patio, smoking cigarettes. Tod does not smoke, but
          some of his friends do.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Christine-Angelena and Timmy arrive home and
          go straight out to the patio where the teenagers are sitting.
          Christine asks one of the teenagers for a cigarette. He gives it to
          her and she puffs and coughs at length.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Just as this is happening, Terry arrives
          home. She sees this scene from the kitchen window and heads straight
          out to the group.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Let's eavesdrop. We want to observe how Terry
          handles this situation.<a name="2links"></a></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#CC3300"><b>[</b>Terry can take a variety of paths.
          Depending on her actions, these subjects may be raised either by the
          actors or the audience: disciplining
          in front of a kid's friends, </font><a style="text-decoration:none" href="2aversion.htm">aversion
          therapy as punishment</a><font color="#CC3300">, immediate
          discipline vs waiting for other parent, </font><a style="text-decoration:nons" href="2discip.htm">disciplining by a step-parent</a><font color="#CC3300">,
          what effect these scenes have on the
          4-year-old.<b>]</b></font></font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Now, let's bring Marcus home. Who is likely
          to tell Marcus what's going on?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#CC3300"><b>[</b>Marcus's reaction varies from class
          to class. An important factor is the dynamic between Marcus and Terry.
          These subjects may arise: parents'
          agreement about punishment, father's
          role as disciplinarian, age-appropriate
          punishments, education
          vs punishment, </font><a style="text-decoration:none" href="2corpor.htm">corporal
          punishment or spanking</a><font color="#CC3300">.<b>]</b></font></font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Let's get a sense of the audience's reaction
          to these parents' handling of the situation. Does someone want to
          comment? Show of hands for agreement with that?</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#CC3300"><b>[Option:</b></font><font color="#333333">
          Let's try another scenario. This one is for Tammy, Martina-Gabriele,
          and the parents. Everyone else can sit down. Martina-Gabriele has told
          her parents that she's going to a party with friends on Friday night.
          What she has <i>not</i> told them is that the party is at a fraternity
          house. But Tammy knows. Tammy sometimes lifts the receiver of an
          extension phone when Martina is talking with friends. So, Tammy
          decides to tell Terry and Marcus. Family, how do you want to play this
          out?</font></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#CC3300">Depending on the actors' choices, these
          topics may arise: step-sibling rivalry,
          parents' reactions to lies or withholding of facts, limits on
          teenagers' activities, dynamic between
          step-parent and step-child.<b>]</b></font></font></p>
