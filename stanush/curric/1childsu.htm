        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#333333">Payment of child support remains one of the
          thorniest issues surrounding divorce and remarriage. Much emotion is
          attached to the issue and child support is often used as a
          &quot;club&quot; both in divorce settlement negotiations and in
          long-term relations among family members.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Although some women do pay child support to
          ex-husbands, the vast majority of payments are in the other direction,
          from men to ex-wives. Historically, women have not been good
          collectors of payments. Regular and on-time payments are almost always
          the doing of the father (on his own) or the doing of the court (by
          requiring payment be made and providing penalty for nonpayment). The
          number of non-paying fathers is unknown, but federal programs report
          that their tracking systems have increased the number of paying
          fathers by 32% (reported in 2000).</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">The term &quot;dead-beat dad&quot; refers to
          fathers who do not make child support payments. Across the 1990s, some
          states took action to trace the whereabouts and financial holdings of
          such fathers. In Texas, the Attorney General's office runs an
          aggressive program that includes posting photographs and detailed
          information on the Internet about &quot;Evaders.&quot; The program
          website is <a href="http://www.oag.state.tx.us/child/mainchil.htm">http://www.oag.state.tx.us/child/mainchil.htm</a>
          .</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300"><b>The following information is not typically
          shared with students in the classroom:</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Adolescents' views about child support may be
          influenced heavily by their own experience or by a friends'
          experience. Rarely will adolescents have a &quot;big picture&quot; of
          child support as a societal issue. As an issue, child support is
          outside the concern of the PEPS curriculum; however, as a common
          concern in blended families today, it may be mentioned in class.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Because of families' emotional view of this
          topic, it is almost always discussed with opinion, not neutrally.
          Negative statements are common: fathers try to weasel out of paying;
          parents play games with the child support payments; if a support
          agreement fails to address college tuition, it may be a voluntary payment, not a
          required one.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Child support may be a topic covered in
          &quot;divorce education,&quot; lectures that divorcing parents are
          required to attend. However, support is rarely otherwise discussed in detail
          outside of lawyers' offices. It is often seen as a negotiable item in
          divorce settlements and this view may extend to family
          discussions.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">In the family field, considerable debate
          surrounds the efficacy of &quot;divorce education&quot; in terms of
          actually changing parents' behavior following divorce. Wallace Goddard
          (2000) has suggested that court-directed curricula fail to change
          behavior, but that sometimes the goal is to simply make parents feel
          guilty about their post-divorce behavior and in that way suppress some
          amount of destructive behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
