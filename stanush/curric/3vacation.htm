        &#160;Communication on Family Vacation</font></b>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#333333">A pleasant surprise for many families is the
          increased closeness that comes with family vacation.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p>What is at work is the &quot;salient family boundary.&quot; At
          home, family members are busy with their individual lives and even
          though they use home as home-base, they may not feel much of a
          boundary around their family. In fact, a boundary always exists.</p>
          <p>That boundary becomes obvious while on vacation. The family feels
          itself as a single unit out in the greater world. There is a clear
          difference between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot;</p>
          <p>With the boundary more obvious, kids enjoy teaming up to go to the
          hotel's ice machine. Older kids, who might not spend much time
          together at home, become friends for vacation activities.</p>
          <p>Once back home, though, the boundary returns to its
          &quot;non-obvious&quot; status.</p>
