        emotional abuse, damages the child's self-esteem</font></p></li>

          <a href="../pdf/4b.pdf"><img border="2" src="../images/4b.jpg" alt="When Abuse Occurs transparency" vspace="4" width="210" height="274"></a></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">I want to give you an overview of factors that are often seen when
        abuse occurs. This doesn't mean that one factor always indicates that a
        child is being abused. Abuse can occur when <i>none </i>of these factors
        is present. But the professionals look for patterns such as these:</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>Stress or anxiety</b> is not being managed. That could be tied to a
          stress like losing a job, or a parent carrying around a lot of anxiety
          all the time for no apparent reason.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>Marital conflict</b>, especially if it's high-level conflict, may be a
          factor.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>Unrealistic expectations</b> of a child can lead to abuse. Toilet
          training is a prime example in this country. Unfortunately, some
          parents think that a child must be trained by age 2, and they're
          willing to beat the child into performing. But normal child
          development predicts that a child won't be <i>completely trained</i>
          under about age 3&#189;.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>Complete training means getting through the night dry, no diaper
          at all, and virtually no accidents. No pull-ups, either!</p>
          <p><font face="Arial">There are a few 2-year-olds out there who can pull that off, but
          not the majority. And it doesn't matter that people <i>say</i> all the
          cousins were trained before age 2, because it's amazing how many
          people re-write history and conveniently forget to mention the kid who
          went to nursery school at 3 in diapers.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Once parents understand what kids can and cannot do at certain
          ages, the pressure is off. Parents then have realistic expectations
          for their children's behavior, and the risk of abuse is much lower.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>Substance abuse</b> &#151; and by that I mean using of any kind:
          drugs, alcohol, whatever &#151; is often a factor in child abuse. The
          parent is not &quot;present&quot; psychologically (Boss, 1999)
          and that represents a loss for the child. It can also mean that the
          parent is more likely to strike out at the child, simply because the
          parent is not in control.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>Low self-esteem</b> of parents is harder to see. A parent may
          strike out at a child from a fatalistic position. &quot;My life is
          crummy. I'm crummy. You must be crummy, too.&quot; So, the child is
          abused because the parent doesn't like himself or herself.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>Role reversal</b> with a child is another factor. This is the
          classic example: a woman beats her 5-year-old son because he didn't
          get her up to get to work on time. The child is expected to be the
          adult, and is punished when he doesn't get it right.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><b>Social isolation</b> is sometimes a factor. This doesn't mean
          that if a family lives 5 miles from the closest neighbor, that they
          abuse their kids. In fact, geography doesn't have anything to do with
          it. The isolation may be from neighbors just over the fence, or next
          door in an apartment. Social isolation means that the kids are
          prevented from playing at other people's houses. They are not allowed
          outside as much as other kids in the neighborhood. Maybe they never
          have anyone visit. Maybe they are never sent to school. Certainly, there are different levels of social
          interaction, and some families <i>are</i> more private, or don't allow
          sleep-overs, for example. But complete social isolation is not usual.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>A history of abuse </b>may be present in some cases, but we don't
        want to make the mistake of assuming that if a kid is abused, he or she
        will grow up to be an abuser. Many abused children grow up and make a
        conscious decision not to abuse their own kids. In fact, we know that
        about 1/3 of abused kids are already taking good care of themselves by
        the time they're adolescents. They figure out what's happening to them
        and they find ways to better their lives.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">This doesn't mean that we won't continue to help kids who are being
        abused. After all, most abused kids still need help. So we still must
        provide counseling or whatever other help those children need. But it's
        amazing that as many as a third of the kids bounce back on their own. We
        need to give those kids more credit for what they manage to do for
        themselves.</font></p>

        in every state there is some law that boils down to </font> the idea of

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">&quot;Gary could be in big legal trouble if

          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">&quot;It could also break your mother's
        heart.&quot; Question for just the women in the room: if this were your
        13-year-old daughter, would you want her to be concerned that your heart
        might be broken? Or would you want her to come to you and tell you
        what's going on?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">&quot;Stop it at once.&quot; This implies that

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Types of Sexual Abuse</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Sexual abuse in any unwanted sexual activity.
        That's the &quot;safest,&quot; &quot;most protective&quot; definition we
        can use. But there are different types of sexual abuse.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Rape</b> is well understood and I will
        assume that you don't need an explanation of that.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Fondling</b> refers to touching the body,
        and usually touching genitalia. Note that fondling can be the adult
        touching the child, or the child touching the adult.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Exhibitionism</b> &#151; do you know what
        that is? We make jokes about it in this culture. We laugh about the
        &quot;dirty old man in the raincoat&quot; flashing his nudity by opening
        the coat. It's not always the raincoat scenario, of course, but that's
        usually what the jokes are about. Now, I'd guess that most people in
        this room would not feel threatened by a flasher in the park, at least
        not if you were with a group of friends and it was broad daylight. But
        under certain conditions, any one of us could be rattled by an
        exhibitionist. And consider how scary it is to little kids, or to people
        more fragile than you. It does rank as a form of sexual abuse.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#333333"><b>Voyeurism</b> &#151;
          another source of jokes in American culture. Are you familiar with
          this term? It means &quot;peeping tom&quot; or the person with
          binoculars watching people undress, or anything else they think
          they're doing in private. We make jokes about it, but it doesn't feel
          funny if you're on the receiving end of this behavior. </font></font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Child pornography</b> &#151; I don't mean
          by this just showing pornography to a child, which in itself is an act
          of both sexual abuse and emotional abuse. I also mean using a child as
          the subject of pornography. This is beyond children's understanding;
          pornography exploits children.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Not the Victim's Fault</b></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#333333">The Parenting Center stresses a key point
          about sexual abuse: it is never the victim's </font>fault<font color="#333333">.
          This is a hard concept for a lot of victims of sex abuse. They may
          feel <i>very</i> responsible. And frequently the perpetrator takes
          advantage of this feeling, making the child feel guilty and secretive.</font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Children are naturally egocentric. They think
        the world revolves around them. Your basic 4-year-old looks over the
        play yard and assumes that the purpose of those other kids' existence is
        <i>to be his playmates.</i> He doesn't see them as individuals like
        himself. He considers only his own interpretation of what happens.
        Understanding that other people have independent thoughts is called
        theory of mind. We think that the earliest children can grasp that is
        about age 5. That means that plenty of kids are still struggling with
        the concept in elementary school.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">This self-centeredness sets kids up for guilt
        and shame not only for their own actions, but for others', too. The
        sexual abuser adds to it, &quot;You'd better not tell anyone because
        then there'd be trouble.&quot; The egocentric child assumes that he or
        she is <i>central</i> to everything. So, they keep the secret all too
        often.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Victims</b>
        &#151; I cannot promise you that these figures are
        true: the rate of victims is <i>perhaps</i> 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6
        boys. I have also seen statistics of 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 10 boys. Why
        the uncertainty? First of all, researchers define &quot;sexual
        abuse&quot; differently. Here, we define it broadly, including all the
        forms we've talked about. Second, sexual abuse may be under-reported.
        The number of reports went down in the 1990s. Researchers don't know if
        that's because there really is less abuse, or because lawsuits are
        making people hesitate before turning in someone. Third, we are pretty
        sure that boys do not report all the abuse that they receive. So, no one
        knows the true extent of sexual abuse. What I can tell you is that even
        &quot;uncertain&quot; statistics are better than what we used to have
        &#151; no statistics. When I was a child, no one discussed sexual
        abuse.&nbsp;</font></p>

        took a lot of courage for people to speak up and call for protection of
        children. But my generation has not done a good job of figuring out what to
        do with the perpetrators. We jail some. We medicate some. We put them in
        therapy. We put them in half-way houses. We put their names on the
        Internet. What we have not been able to do is stop them from repeating.
        The known recidivism rate is 20% to 30% (Grubin &amp; Wingate, 1996) and
        we don't know how many offenders repeat and don't get caught. This is work for
        your generation. But don't think it's going to be easy. This is tough.
        Sexual predators often genuinely believe that they mean children no
        harm. It's a fact that we have not been able to reach many of them, and
        yet plenty of smart people have tried. Maybe it takes a full generation
        to move just one step toward a solution. My generation got the issue out
        of the closet. Yours may be the one to really change the character of
        treatment.</font><font color="#CC3300"><b>]</b></font></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Perpetrators</b> &#151; The
        great majority are male. Certainly there have been cases of female sex
        abusers, but their numbers are small. There appears to be a pattern in
        abusers; most were abused when they were younger.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>95% of Abusers</b> &#151;&nbsp;
          &#133; are known to the child. This means that the sexual abuser is
          usually Dad, or Grandpa, or the camp counselor, or the fellow who
          lives down the street. Sex offenders almost always know their victims
          well and they typically work hard at building a close relationship
          with the child and even the child's family.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Passive Parents</b> &#151; </font><font color="#333333">There
        may be a passive parent who knows or &quot;tries not to know&quot; what
        is going on. This may be a mother who is covering up abuse of her own.
        Or maybe it's a mom who realizes that if the sexual abuse comes out in
        the open, she will lose the family breadwinner. Or the family may break
        apart.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Youngest Case on Record</b> &#151;
        The youngest age we know of was a 2-week-old girl. This was a case of penetration&nbsp;and
        she died. </font><font color="#CC3300"><b>[</b>Students may ask what
        &quot;penetration&quot; is. A simple answer is best: &quot;an adult
        penis is inserted in the baby's vagina. Tissue is torn; repair may not
        be possible. In the case of this infant, no repair was possible.&quot;
        Students may be silent for some time as they accommodate this
        information; most speakers will want to proceed with the talk quietly
        and slowly until students are ready to join discussion again.<b>]</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><b>Abuse can extend beyond childhood</b> &#151;
        Sometimes we get impatient with an older victim and we ask &quot;Why
        didn't she just a, b, c.&quot; One of the toughest things about sexual
        abuse is understanding how helpless the victim feels. So, our logic
        cannot apply to all situations.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CC3300" face="Arial"><b>[Optional video: Eve's Story]</b></font></p>
          <blockquote>
          <p><font face="Arial">This video speaks to some of the points we just made. The abuser is
          almost always well known to the child. A passive parent may be
          involved <font color="#333333">
        &#151; watch for that in this story. And in this story we see that abuse
          can extend beyond childhood.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">As you watch this video, you may feel an urge
          to laugh or giggle. For a lot of people, this is a normal reaction to
          the anxiety that surrounds sexual abuse. I never criticize people if
          that laugh comes out. Also, we know that we use humor and jokes to
          help us handle tough subjects. So, if you feel a laugh, or you hear
          one in the room, don't take offense. You may also hear someone groan
          or get mad. All valid reactions to a tough subject. Be patient with
          each other.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Did you pick up on the passive parent? Yes, the
        mother. She didn't feel quite right, but she didn't want to know what
        was wrong. She was willing to assume her anxiety came from her own
        childhood.&nbsp;</font></p>

        may be the extent of appropriate comment. If the class is talkative,
        follow their subjects. Typical concerns are break-up of the family (see
        Module 5) and
        father's incarceration.<b>]</b></font></p>
