          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">We've talked about big issues, like sexual
          abuse, coming out in the open. Now, let's consider some of the
          things that might happen next.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Think back to the Ann Landers letter from D.R.,
          the 13-year-old girl who's afraid of getting Gary in trouble.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Let's say D.R. tells her mother what's
          going on. Then what?</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Yes, Gary may be kicked out of the house.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Or, yes, he may be arrested.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Good point. Mom may tell D.R. to stop lying.
          So, she may want to deny what's going on.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Yes. D.R. may be kicked out of the house. And
          what? Sent to grandma's to live?</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">You're right: someone might get hurt.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">No matter what happens next, it's going to be
          rough, isn't it? Some families fall apart. That cookie may crumble.
        The <i>fear</i> of the family falling apart keeps some families living
        with the abuse or keeping the secret of past abuse.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Maybe the abuser is the primary source of money
        for the family. Or maybe the abuser has threatened to do something <i>worse</i>
        if anyone tells. An abuser may say, &quot;I'll kill you if you tell
        anyone.&quot; The victim doesn't think logically: if the abuser is sent
        to prison, killing won't be possible. On the other hand, maybe the
        victim is afraid the abuser <i>won't</i> be sent to prison. The victim
        sees telling as being a big risk.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#CC3300" face="Arial"><b>[Optional video: Eva's Story. </b>If you
        used the video, you may want to revisit the &quot;aftermath&quot; for
        Eva's family, pointing out that Eva spoke up to save her sister. We
        don't know who the abuser would have chosen for the next victim. Perhaps
        a grandchild, someday.<b>]</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">As a PEPS Educator, I still recommend that
        people tell the secret. The damage that comes with the cookie crumbling
        is likely to be less than the damage that comes with keeping the secret.
        But I won't dismiss the importance of a break-up of the family. The
        family may have a lot of heartbreak ahead of them. But there's another way to
        look at it: the whole family can carry the burden of the problem
        instead of one little child carrying it alone.<a name="5stats"></a></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">From society's point of view, we want abuse
        uncovered. Most researchers believe that sex offenses are under-reported
        (Grubin &amp; Wingate, 1996) and this may skew all the <a style="text-decoration:none" href="5stats.htm">statistics</a>
        we have about sex abuse. In general, we wonder about all abuse
        statistics. We do have more abuse reported today than 30 years ago, but
        that does not mean there is more abuse. More likely, it means that we
        have made reporting easier and more acceptable.&nbsp;</font></p>
