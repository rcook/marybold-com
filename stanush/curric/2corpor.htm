          <p><font color="#333333">The Parenting Center takes an unequivocal
          stand on spanking: it is never recommended. There are too many other

          It's a risk. You can't guarantee that you'll never be so angry that
          you hit too hard. You can't guarantee that your slap won't make the
          kid lose his balance and end up on the brick fireplace with a gash in
          his forehead. Or brain damage from a fall. It's a risk that I'm not
          willing to take.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Bold's third comment, when pressed:</font><font color="#333333">
          When I was a new mom, I watched a debate on spanking on the Phil
          Donahue show. That was a TV talk show like Oprah, except that Phil is
          an old white guy. The debate was raging: the experts said Never Spank
          and the audience said Are You Going to Let the 2-year-old Run In Front
          of a Truck? (Always an odd argument for spanking!) The debate was
          getting nowhere. But I noticed something. Every time an older woman
          spoke, the comment was something like: &quot;If I had it to do over, I
          wouldn't spank. It wasn't necessary and it just caused more
          problems.&quot; That comment was made by several older women. Neither
          Phil nor his experts noticed. But I did. Many times I make a choice
          without &quot;proof.&quot; I can listen to other people's experience
          and I can hear them say that I maybe I need to avoid regrets later.
          That's what I did and I'm glad I did.</font><font color="#CC3300"><b>]</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300"><b>The following information is not typically
          shared with students in the classroom:</b></font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Americans clearly consider spanking a
          reasonable child-rearing technique. This is not the thinking around
          the world, but Americans have not routinely compared their techniques
          with others'. For example, in Sweden, corporal punishment is literally
          against the law. In the U.S., such punishment is only recently
          controlled in school settings.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">In working with families on this topic, we
          may find high resistance to using alternatives to spanking. Many
          people are defensive about the use of spanking, even if they did not
          like to be spanked when they were children. Depending on the venue,
          family and parenting professionals may need to limit debate in order
          to avoid barriers to other discussions.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">This is the case for PEPS Educators in the
          classroom. For many adolescents, the issue of spanking is not an
          important theme, anyway. A classroom debate may not represent the
          issue at all, but instead be an exercise in challenging an adult. If
          this is so, the PEPS Educator has already lost as soon as the debate
          begins.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#CC3300">Even if students are genuinely interested in
          &quot;defending corporal punishment,&quot; they are likely defending a
          piece of personal identity. (&quot;My dad hit me, but he's my dad and
          I love him. Don't tell me he was doing something bad.&quot;) If the
          PEPS Educator pursues the argument, Dad will only look worse and
          student will only be more offended.</font></p>
