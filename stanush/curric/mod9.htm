        Resiliency</b></font></p>

        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial"><a name="1adverse"></a>Humans are amazing at taking care of
        themselves. They are resilient, or at least they can be. Resiliency is
        &quot;bouncing back,&quot; specifically, bouncing back after <a style="text-decoration:none" href="9adverse.htm"> hard
        times</a>.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">In terms of abuse, we don't want to minimize
        the damage that abuse causes, but we also don't want to overlook the
        bounce-back that some people are capable of.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">We think that about 10% of kids are
        &quot;hardy.&quot; These are the kids who live in extreme conditions but
        make it, anyway. They seem to beat the odds.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">And by adolescence, we see that as many as 1/3
        of abused or neglected kids are turning their lives around. They learn
        how to build support networks, even if their home lives are not
        supporting. They reach out to friends or neighbors, maybe a teacher or a
        coach, maybe a relative other than parents. By reaching out, they create
        an adaptive environment for themselves. They don't just survive, just
        barely cope. They cope very well even in difficult situations.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Now, we don't just sit back and see which kids
        are resilient and which aren't. We want to support kids and families who
        are trying to move toward resiliency. We can offer support as resiliency
        skills are learned.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">And the experts are certain that resiliency <i>can</i>
        be learned. We don't have to be born with certain traits (Walsh, 1998).
        We can learn to &quot;live well [even] when &#133; brought up badly&quot; (Wolin
        &amp; Wolin, 1993).<a name="9strateg"></a></font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">One way to engender resiliency is to become
        aware of how we process stress and anxiety and then create <a style="text-decoration:none" href="9strateg.htm"> strategies</a> to
        react to stress and anxiety.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">I can tell you exactly what I do. When I feel
        anxiety (on the inside), I admit it to myself with gentle self-talk. I
        say, &quot;Hmmm. This must be anxiety because I'm not able to even point
        to my issue. But I can settle down and let my real worry surface.&quot;
        It works after a few minutes.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">When I feel stress or pressure (from the
        outside), I can pinpoint it immediately. &quot;This is stress from the
        flat tire I just spotted on my car.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333" face="Arial">Now, even if I can't relieve that specific
        stress immediately, I can do other things that make my flat-tire day
        bearable.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#333333">For me, that means taking time during the week
        to get out to a movie. I go alone. I love to go to a matinee alone, so I
        don't have to talk to anyone. I can even go to bad movies because I
        don't have to listen to a companion putting them down. I <i>love</i> bad
        movies.&nbsp;</font></font></p>

        first? </font><font color="#CC3300"><b>[</b>If time allows, ask groups
        to report from an overhead transparency so that everyone can see their
        entries. Help count their entries and announce total numbers, leading
        the applause for every announcement. When subsequent groups report,
        duplicate entries will be obvious, so comment should be made on the
        differing entries. If a late-reporting group has added entries upon
        seeing early-reporting groups' work, laugh and encourage applause for
        the fast-thinkers who have learned so many &quot;extra&quot; things in
        just the past few minutes. If entries are specific to ethnicity or
        religion, take the opportunity to &quot;broaden&quot; the concepts. For
        example, &quot;Yes, church is a great example; many people find
        rejuvenation by going to church or temple.&quot;<b>]</b></font></font></p>
