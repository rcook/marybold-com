          you don't like, please do let me or your teacher know that you want to
          be excused. You can always go work in the library for an hour and
          that's fair. I want to deliver information to you, but only if you are

          <p><font color="#333333">So, we start with our legal definitions. The
          Census Bureau&nbsp;calls a family &quot;a group of two persons or more
          (one of whom is a householder) related by birth, marriage or adoption
          and residing together&quot; (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1998).&nbsp;And
          &quot;householder&quot; refers to whoever owns or rents the home (U.S.
          Bureau of the Census, 2001).</font></p>

          <p>We don't have to live by the Census Bureau definition here in the classroom, but
          it's a good starting point for discussion, so let's do what we'd do in
          a college classroom: let's de-construct the definition.</p>

          <p>I need 2 volunteers who are next to each other. Doesn't matter if
          we have a man and woman, or two men, two women, anyone can do this and
          you don't even have to stand up. Thank you &#151; these 2 will serve as
          our first family. <font color="#CC3300"><b>[</b>Any configuration works as
          students volunteer; female students are frequently the first
          volunteers, though.<b>]</b></font> A woman and her daughter; who wants to be the
          parent? Thank you. Let's connect these two with a pink string.</p>
          <p>I've named these two a family of mother and daughter. So, do they
          meet the U.S. Census Bureau definition of family? Yes. So, what about
          other people in their lives who might be family?</p>
          <p>Ah, the father. OK, where's a man nearby? Thank you. We'll make
          this father live in another home, so he's not part of the
          family-by-definition,
          right? Another string running from the man to &#151; to whom? Who will
          hold the other end of the string? OK. The daughter. You see that as
          the family connection?</p>
          <p>Well, does the father count as family by the legal definition? No.
          Out of household, out of family. But does this daughter call him
          family? Sure. Now, you wanted the daughter to hold the string,
          but I'm going to insist that this father and mother have a connection,
          even though they are not living together. Let me offer a white string
          to these parents. Will you grant me that it <i>could</i> be a pink string?
          Pink for family?&nbsp;</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><b><font color="#CC3300">The following information is not typically
          shared with students in the classroom: </font></b><font color="#CC3300">Ex-spouses
            are examples of &quot;latent relationships&quot; that may be
            re-activated at a later point in time (Riley, 1983). As divorce and
            re-marriage continue to describe a large proportion of American
            couples, there is a growing matrix of latent relationships that
            affects not just the once-married couple but also all the in-laws,
            any children from the marriage, and also children created in
            re-marriages. A relationship may appear to end, but because of the
            matrix it has not really been severed. More likely, it is latent or
            lying dormant. It may be re-activated when family is
            &quot;convened&quot; for a wedding or a funeral. It may be
            re-activated when someone needs something: an ex-spouse may be
            called on for care, support, or finances in case of grave illness or
            financial emergency.</font></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>OK. You're telling me this couple is an ex-couple and they don't
          consider themselves family. But you'll grant me that there's still a
          connection? My white string states that these people are still
          connected &#151; probably for life.</p>
          <p>What other family might our mom-daughter dyad call their family? OK &#151;
          grandparents. Who's old in this room? Who's willing to be grandparents
          to this girl? Thank you. We have a grandmother here and a grandfather
          there. How about a long gold string going to the granddaughter?</p>
          <p>What about other grandparents? OK, more gold string from these
          other grandparents to the granddaughter, right? So, lots of string
          emanating from her position. What about the parents' relationships
          with these grandparents?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Who else? OK. An aunt and uncle and 2 cousins will do. More gold
          string from the daughter &#151; running it to whom?</p>
          <p>Let me suggest another extended family member &#151; Auntie Gracie.
          She's not&nbsp; actually a relative, but she lives with the aunt and
          uncle, and everyone considers her family. She is &quot;fictive
          kin.&quot; Research has shown that &quot;family&quot; refers to the
          people we're in contact with &#151; who we communicate with, who we
          celebrate with. Most of us call those people family, regardless of
          whether we're blood relatives (Jorgenson, 1989). So, the gold string to our
          daughter over there must also be held by Auntie Gracie.</p>
          <p>Now, we've moved across multiple households, and we're still
          claiming family with a lot of string, but our government is not
          calling this family.</p>
          <p>Well, historically, people have always defined family the way
          they've wanted to. Our usual term for the small unit &#151; mom and
          daughter over there &#151; is nuclear family. And the extensions out
          to the other relatives &#151; that's extended family.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>But I want to point out that the daughter in the nuclear family has
          two homes, really. She spends time at Dad's place, too. So, this is
          actually a bi-nuclear family. The English majors in the room will want
          us to be specific: the nucleus is the center part, but this family has
          two nucleuses or two nuclei. So, the &quot;bi&quot; in bi-nuclear
          means there are two centers of growth.</p>
          <p>If we move some extended family into the same house as our nuclear
          family, they become &quot;legal&quot; family by definition, but these
          people already considered themselves family. So, our legal definitions
          are pretty narrow and that's typical of most definitions.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Anyone defining family is probably doing it for a narrow purpose.
          On a form, &quot;family&quot; almost always means &quot;just who's
          living in the home.&quot; Sometimes the name on the form is very
          narrow: who's paying for this kid's braces?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Most of us do not define family when we talk about our family
          members. Most of us just accept that we all know what the word means,
          but we also know that it means something different to each of us (Trost,
          1990). I
          have a friend who lives just with her cat. Now, the Census Bureau
          doesn't call that a family, but my friend does.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Let's go back to our mom-daughter nuclear family and change that
          composition. Let's marry mom off to a man who has a son. I'd like to
          start some green string &#151; to where? I need two men&nbsp; who are
          nearby &#151; thank you. Green is now representing &quot;blended&quot;
          family members. If we use the daughter as our reference point again,
          who are we calling family at this point? Do we still need some pink string to signify the nuclear family members of dad and son before
          they blended with mom and daughter?</p>
          <p>What other string do we need for the folks over in this corner? <font color="#CC3300"><b>[</b>Continue

          <p><font color="#333333">Television hasn't always given us such a wide
          variety of family types. About mid-century in the 1950s and 1960s, the
          typical image of the American family was a dad who went off to work, a
          mom who stayed home, and a couple of kids who were born after that mom
          and dad's first and only marriage.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">But that was only an image! The majority of
          American families never actually matched that image. In 1940, 41% of
          Americans looked like that. In 1963, the figure was 43% (Hernandez,
          1993). And those were the top years! So, the image never matched even
          half of American families.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">We often have images in our culture that
          don't reflect the way things really were. For example, most people
          believe that 100 years ago, the &quot;extended family&quot; meant that
          grandparents lived with the parents and children. The assumption is
          that children received support from their grandparents and that
          today's children don't get the benefits of extended family.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">But 100 years ago, most kids didn't know a
          grandparent, or if they did it was only for about 10 years (Bold,
          2001; Cherlin &amp; Furstenberg, 1986; Hagestad, 1988).</font></p>
          <p>Just looking at the shape of families then and now, we can see that
          families have changed a lot, and kids today are much more likely to be
          connected to their grandparents. My old-days picture shows a pyramid:
          a few old people at the top, lots of kids at the bottom. My now-days
          picture shows a different population shape, more of a block with
          almost as many old people in the society as there are kids.</p>

          <p><font color="#333333">That brings us to my picture of the beanpole
          family composition. More and more, this is how families are built (Longino
          &amp; Earle, 1996; Giarrusso, Silverstein, &amp; Bengtson, 1996).
          Youngest generation at the bottom would be you folks. Next up is the
          generation that raised you. Next up is what I'd call &quot;grandparent
          generation.&quot; Show of hands, please: how many people in this room
          have a living grandparent? How about 2 grandparents alive? 3? 4? More?
          With blended families today, plenty of folks have 6 and 8 grandparents
          (Henry &amp; Plunkett, 1996). More than 10 years ago, researchers
          figured that 1/3 of grandparents were also step-grandparents (Longino
          &amp; Earle, 1996). It's higher now, but I don't know the statistic.</font></p>
          <p><font color="#333333">Can we keep going up the beanpole? Anyone
          here with a great-grandparent alive? Yes? Then your family spans 4
          generations. Not many families have ever done that before. I'll go
          ahead and ask, anyone here have 5 generations living? Medical
          researchers tell us that will be the next trend, as more and more
          people live past 100.</font></p>

          You've done a superb job covering family
          composition with me. I'll now make things more difficult and move us
          into the topic of family dynamic.</font></p>
