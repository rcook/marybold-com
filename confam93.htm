          per thousand and the rate for unmarried women ages 18 to 19 rose from 39 to 70 per

          increase in the proportion of women of childbearing age who are unmarried (from 29% in 1960 to 46% in 1994),
          concurrent with an increase in nonmarital cohabitation.</font></b></li>

          <p align="left"><b><font color="#996633">At the same time, childbearing within marriage
          declined: births to married women declined from 4 million in 1960 to 2.7 million in 1994
          and the birth rate for married women fell from 157 per thousand in 1960 to 84 per
          thousand in 1994.11 All of these measures have stabilized in the mid-1990s, as the
