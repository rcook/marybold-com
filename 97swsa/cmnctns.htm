    <blockquote>
        <p>Much of American business is conducted with electronic
        mail and, increasingly, so is higher education.
        Today&#146;s educators offer &#147;extended office
        hours&#148; by way of e-mail, inviting students to make
        inquiries in a text-based mode. Since a professor&#146;s
        answer can be sent back to the student with the push of a
        single button (&#147;reply&#148;), communication is
        faster and usually more clear than through use of
        telephone or voice mail.</p>
        <p>Some professors ask that assignments be submitted
        electronically. Practical considerations include size of
        class, length of assignment, due dates within the
        semester, and computer lab access for students who do not
        own computers.</p>
        <p>When electronic work is shared among all class members
        (distributing answers to a class e-mail list, for
        example), a unique form of group work emerges. Students
        and professors report enjoyment at taking part in
        stimulating discussion and sharing opinions in depth and
        in detail. </p>
        <p>These benefits have been reported:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The medium promotes critical thinking and
                reflective communication.</li>
            <li>Students experience more discussion than in-class
                time allows.</li>
            <li>The relative anonymity of e-mail is attractive to
                some students who tend not to volunteer comments
                in class.</li>
            <li>Asynchronous communication fits all
                students&#146; schedules.</li>
            <li>Professors can observe the flow of communication
                before deciding how much or when to intervene
                with their own comments.</li>
            <li>Skillbuilding in the use of computers.</li>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Synchronous Internet communication is variously called
        conferencing, chatting, and on-line discussing. Class
        meetings can be accomplished in this mode, or simply
        non-credit study group sessions. Students can receive
        immediate help with problems, especially if a professor
        or teaching assistant &#147;sits in&#148; on a session. </p>
        <p>Participants must adjust to the distraction of
        scrolling text on their computer monitors and, usually,
        interruptions of other participants&#146; questions amid
        an on-going discussion. Most students consider these
        minor inconveniences.</p>
        <p>Of greater concern is the risk of technical problems.
        Disruption on a university server can cancel a
        conference, causing the need to reschedule for all
        partcipants. Too, a computer problem for any one of the
        participants can be seen as a failure of the method.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>A staple of distance learning, the videoconference
        allows students in remote locales to make eye contact
        with a professor and fellow students on other campuses.
        Sophisticated equipment utilizing either satellite
        transmission or telephone service typically provides
        views on 25&quot; or larger color monitors and high
        quality sound. The teacher&#146;s location may include
        computer, Internet access, and document camera to further
        enhance presentations.</p>
        <p>While some students report discomfort at appearing
        &#147;on TV,&#148; professors and remote students
        generally agree that videoconference is the preferred
        medium for distance education. When combined with other
        uses of technology&#151;specifically, communication via
        e-mail and delivery of course material through sites on
        the World Wide Web&#151;videoconferencing can offer a
        full educational experience comparable in quality to
        on-campus courses.</p>
        <p>High quality transmission of a videoconference is
        expensive. Studio equipment costs of tens of thousands of
        dollars; maintaining satellite transmission and even
        telephone line transmission requires salaries for support
        personnel. Despite the cost, universities make use of
        videoconferencing to reach students who would otherwise
        be unable to take courses. Increasing numbers of distant
        education students justify the expense of the technology.</p>
        <p>Desktop videoconference, linking individual students
        from their own homes or local campuses, may provide the
        next generation of distance learning. Currently, software
        and a camera can be added to a personal computer for less
        than $500. Transmission is via the Internet or telephone
        lines. Video quality and audio quality are lacking, by
        popular standards. For example, most video options are
        limited to 10 - 20 frames per second, compared to the
        common usage of 30 frames per second for videotape.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Perhaps one of the most powerful uses of the Internet
        is the publishing of books and reports by both faculty
        and students. It is also an area of great debate as
        academia decides how to value such publishing and how to
        manage practical aspects of it.</p>
        <p>Compared to print publishing, electronic or digital
        publishing offers greater speed to publication, lower
        cost, and wider distribution. All of these factors will
        encourage a larger number of writers. Whether readership
        will be increased is not known. However, writing and
        readership in narrow disciplines will almost certainly
        increase. When only a small audience (of a few hundred or
        a few thousand) is identified for a manuscript, print
        publishers are likely to pass on a project since
        recouping printing costs is not assured. By contrast,
        electronic publishers can produce the
        small-audience-document since the cost of posting it on
        the Internet is relatively small. Additionally, certain
        narrow audiences can be reached through the Internet,
        especially if computer users access material through
        filters which the publisher can identify as appropriate
        to the publication.</p>
        <p>A major constraint in electronic publishing is
        reconciling current U.S. copyright law with common
        practices by Internet users. Those practices include
        duplication of copyrighted material, distribution of
        material without approval, and the selective use of
        elements from one work in the creation of a new work. For
        example, a graphic is easily &#147;grabbed&#148; from a
        web page, copied, and inserted in a new document. The
        sheer number of web pages in existence defies attempts at
        policing copyright infringement. Only the most widespread
        and most blatant unauthorized uses of material are likely
        to even be seen.</p>
        <p>For academics, inexpensive electronic publishing is
        both boon and threat. On the one hand, many professors
        can publish their reputable works which have not been
        accepted by journals for a number of understandable
        reasons. On the other hand, many professors can publish
        their substandard works which have been rejected by
        journals for good reason. In short, any one can post any
        document, regardless of its quality or worth.</p>
        <p>Peer review journals, generally acknowledged as the
        safest conduits for publication of research, may
        translate to the Internet in the future. Indeed, in some
        fields of study, electronic journals are already the
        norm. For most academics, however, the print journal
        remains the appropriate publisher as the professor seeks
        recognition in a field or tenure from a university. How
        Internet journals will rank among publications has not
        been addressed yet. Presumably, universities will assign
        some value to electronic publication as more faculty
        members present their papers and books in that format and
        ask that they be recognized as scholarly work.</p>
        <p>Electronic publishing allows</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the publishing of many new books from many more
                authors,</li>
            <li>quick revision of material,</li>
            <li>distribution outside of the traditional book
                market,</li>
            <li>publishing in narrow disciplines to small
                audiences,</li>
            <li>textbooks customizable to individual courses,</li>
            <li>increased number of color graphics,</li>
            <li>animation and sound to accompany text,</li>
            <li>display formats which can be customized by each
                reader.</li>
