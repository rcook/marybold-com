<p align="left">Today&#146;s undergraduates in the field of aging
are varied in age and experience. The great equalizer for these
students is the challenge of utilizing technology for the benefit
of their studies and, eventually, of their clients.</p>

<p>Virtually all students today have access to computers in
university labs.</p>

<p>Increasing numbers of students use home computers, and those
who do generally prefer their own over university computers.</p>

<p>Traditional (younger) college students come to campus as
experienced computer users. National Center for Education
Statistics from 1993 show that more than a quarter of American
schoolchildren use computers at home, and more than half use
computers at school. These figures suggest that Americans&#146;
exposure to computers is sufficient to allow the incorporation of
computer technology in the undergraduate curriculum. </p>

<p>Nontraditional (older) students have proved as competent as
their younger counterparts in computer skill building and
creative uses of educational technology. In our own survey of
students at TWU, we found that older students maintain positive
attitude toward the use of computers in coursework and expect to
use computers in their education and in their careers.</p>
