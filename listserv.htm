        <p>Size of group is the usual determinant for creating a listserv for
        group communication rather than relying on &#147;group e-mail.&#148;
        Privacy and security may also be issues, however. While all
        Internet-based communications are potentially public and open to
        scrutiny, the perception of privacy may dictate choices. Whose
        perception? Ideally, the participants in the communication medium would
        have the opportunity to vote on which route to follow. In some settings,
        an institution&#146;s server would be assumed to be the more protective
        communication medium. However, many people (especially those who meet face-to-face
        in addition to using computer mediated communication) may feel increased
        locus of control by creating their own mailing list for the group of
        participants.</p>
        <p><b>Arguments in favor of creating a listserv:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Set-up is handled by someone else, as is maintenance if
            participants drop-out or change e-mail addresses. All members are
            enrolled at the same time; additional members can be added later.</li>
          <li>Each person&#146;s e-mail address is known to the listserv manager
            but will not be known to other participants unless a message is
            posted to the listserv. This provides relative anonymity for the
            participant who chooses to &#147;lurk.&#148;</li>
          <li>Each person can enter the listserv by simply typing in the
            listserv address in a mail message or clicking on the saved listserv
            address in an e-mail address book. By contrast, group e-mail
            requires entering multiple addresses in an address book and storing
            them on the computer. In case of hardware or software failure, the
            e-mail addresses may be erased from participants&#146; personal
            computers..</li>
          <li>A listserv manager can provide a certain amount of supervision of
            messages posted to the listserv. When inappropriate messages are
            posted, an “institutional&#148; reprimand may be accomplished. In
            group e-mail, participants may feel awkward in dealing with
            inappropriate use of the communication medium and may spend time and
            energy managing reprimands, apologies, face-saving interactions, and
            so forth.</li>
          <li>Some automatic safeguards can be built into the listserv program
            so that irritants such as duplicate postings can be minimized.
            Similarly, listserv participants can be protected from excessively
            long messages that may tie up systems and clog mailboxes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Arguments in favor of using group e-mail:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The group is not reliant on an institution&#146;s server that may
            be &#147;down&#148; on occasion.</li>
          <li>Set-up can be accomplished immediately without being scheduled
            with a server manager (although set-up does depend on co&#246;peration of
            all group members).</li>
          <li>Self-management provides locus of control, which may be important
            to some individuals. If the number of participants is small, creating or maintaining mail lists is not
            a burden.</li>
          <li>The group is not supervised by server managers or any one else who
            may have access to listservs operating on the server.</li>
          <li>Communication can continue indefinitely, whereas some servers may
            impose limits by semester, for example.</li>
          <li>Novice e-mail users may prefer a personal approach to
            computer-mediated group communication.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Working with Tech Support">Working with Tech Support</a></h3>
        <p>Consult with a technical expert (hereafter called &#147;Tech Support&#148;)
        from the start of planning a listserv, even if initial contact is only
        to ascertain availability of resources/services.</p>
        <p>After conducting a needs assessment of your group, share plans,
        priorities, and preferences with Tech Support. A major decision will be
        whether the listserv will be moderated or unmoderated.&nbsp; Work with both the
        group and Tech Support in order to disseminate how-to instructions,
        publicity about the listserv (if appropriate), and listserv netiquette.</p>
        <p>Consult both your group <i>and</i> Tech Support about concerns&#151;AKA
        horror stories. This short list alludes to the magnitude of headaches
        that can accompany listserv and group e-mail communication:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Angry at not being able to &#147;unsubscribe&#148; from a
            listserv, a user attached a large executable file to a &#147;flaming&#148;
            message and sent it on automatic pilot to the listserv on a Friday
            evening. By Monday morning, every user had received 250+ copies of
            the message and attachment.</li>
          <li>Irritated by a &#147;newbie&#146;s&#148;&nbsp;elementary questions
            to the listserv, a user SHOUTED at the entire list and made rude
            comments that may very well have made someone cry.</li>
          <li>Eager to be responsive to other people&#146;s comments, a user
            replied with comments such as &#147;Neat idea! Way to go!&#148; and
            distributed the message to the entire list&#133;frequently.</li>
          <li>Intent on straightening out an upcoming schedule, a user responded
            to Ms. X&#146;s posting with &#147;Glad I saw your name today&#151;I&#146;ve
            been meaning to tell you that we need to change our lunch date from
            12:00 to 1:00,&#148; sending the message to the entire list instead
            of to only Ms. X.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Listserv Netiquette">Listserv Netiquette</a></h3>
        <p>These are typical rules for listservs. This list is not complete!
        (This material is a mix of material drawn from many online sources.)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>  Persons posting messages not related to the interests of the group will be warned once that continued
            posting of unrelated items to this list will result in subsequent removal
            from the list without warning.</li>
          <li>Persons engaging in &#147;flaming,&#148; advertising, or sending profane, lewd, illicit, or illegal messages to the list will be
            summarily removed from the list without warning.
          </li>
          <li>If you reply to a message you receive from the list, the list is set to
            automatically reply to the sender only, not to the entire list.  If you wish
            the entire list to see your reply, please e-mail a copy of your reply to the
            regular posting address. <b>(Note: a listserv may alternately
            automatically reply to the full list, requiring users to enter a
            different e-mail address when intending to send to a single person.)</b>
          </li>
          <li>A listserv is like an electronic bulletin board&#151;it allows subscribers to
            write and respond to messages sent to an entire group of people.  When you
            e-mail to the listserv, all subscribers read your message.  When you submit a message, it should be
            something that you want to share with the entire mailing list, since your
            submission is distributed to all of the other people on that list.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>Sending a message in all caps (UPPER CASE) implies that the sender
            is shouting. This is offensive to some recipients.
          </li>
          <li>Messages sent to a Listserv should pertain to the particular Listserv.
            Users should not send or respond to personal messages, or messages that
            don't pertain to the  Listserv.  Many people consider receiving a message
            that doesn&#146;t apply to them &#147;junk&#148; email. Most users find it annoying.
          </li>
          <li>A user may inadvertently send an inappropriate message.  When this happens, Listmembers should not exacerbate the problem
            by replying to the list with a public reprimand to the person who posted in
            error. Listmembers who want to help new users to use the list properly
            should address messages privately to the individual who misposted in the
            first place.<br>
