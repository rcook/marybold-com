<p><u>Timeline of marriage-related events</u></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonial times. Women born at this time grew up to produce 7
children (Gibson, 1993).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19th century. Reasons for divorce were adultery, insanity, and union
between blood relatives (&quot;Class Notes,&quot; 1998).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1850. The divorce rate was 5% (&quot;Class Notes,&quot; 1998).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1879-1948. Divorce was abolished in the state of South Carolina
(Cook, 1998).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1880-1920. American cultural concerns were social reform,
the endangered family, and industrialization.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1887. First compilation of federal statistics on marriage and
divorce began (Cook, 1998).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1890. The median age at first marriage was 22.0 for women and 26.1
for men (Kornblum, 1994).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1900. Women born at this time grew up to produce 2.3 children
(Gibson, 1993).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1903. The Inter-Church Conference on Marriage and Divorce convened
and encouraged churches to prohibit remarriage (Cook, 1998).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1906. The U. S. Congress convened the National Congress on Uniform
Divorce Laws, which failed to convince states to relinquish their autonomy in marriage and
divorce matters (Cook, 1998).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1910. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Blame for divorce shifted from individuals to industrialization,
urbanization, and the women's movement (Cook, 1998).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The median age at first marriage was 21.6 for women and 25.1 for men
(Kornblum, 1994).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916. The U.S. led the world in the rate of divorce (Cook, 1998).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1920s and 1930s. Women born at this time grew up to produce 3
children (Gibson, 1993).<br>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1920s. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. American cultural concerns were divorce, extramarital sex, changing
women's roles, and the personal domain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. 1920: The marriage/divorce ratio was 7.5:1 (Whitmire, 1997).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Mid-1920s: Following divorce, mothers became the preferred guardians
of children based on &quot;the best interests of the child&quot; (adopted from England's
Guardianship of Infants Act of 1925) (Cook, 1998).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1930. The median age at first marriage was 21.3 for women and 24.3
for men (Kornblum, 1994).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1940s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. 1940: The marriage/divorce ratio was 6:1 (Whitmire, 1997).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Late 1940s: Women born at this time grew up to produce 2.1 children
(Gibson, 1993).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1950s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Functionalist theory held that marital quality was influenced by how
spouses performed specific roles to support the function of the family (Hendrix, 1997).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Instrumental activities for men and expressive activities for women
resulted in high differentiation of roles and (supposedly) subsequent high marital quality
(Hendrix, 1997).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. American cultural concerns were security and a return to
&quot;normal&quot; gender roles.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. 1950: The median age at first marriage was 20.3 for women and 22.8
for men (Crispell, 1994; Kornblum, 1994).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1960s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Scholars called for creation of a theory of marital prediction
(Larson &amp; Holman, 1994).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. MQ study considered static, sociocultural, and family of origin
factors (Larson &amp; Holman, 1994).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. 1960: The marriage/divorce ratio was 3.8:1 (Whitmire, 1997). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. 1960: The proportion of births occurring out of wedlock was 5%
(Furstenberg, 1996). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. 1960: 19% of women with children under age 6 were employed
(Furstenberg, 1996).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. 1969: No-fault divorce law was passed in California (Cook, 1998).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1970s and 1980s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The definition of marital success shifted from one of instability
(typically marked by separation and divorce) to spouses' subjective view of their marriage
(typically using words such as &quot;satisfaction&quot;) (Clark-Nicholas &amp;
Gray-Little, 1991).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. No-fault divorce legislation spread across the U.S. (Wagner, 1998).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1970s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. This decade was essentially the end of research into homogamy
(Larson &amp; Holman, 1994). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Couples' interests shifted from instrumental functioning of
marriages to increased companionship in marriage (Erickson, 1993).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The relationship between MQ and family stage was firmly established
by many studies (Glenn, 1990).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. American cultural concerns were women in the workforce and
alternative family forms (cohabitation, never-married mothers, stepfamilies, gay and
lesbian relationships).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act passed (but has still not been
adopted by all states) (Cook, 1998).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. 1970: The median age at first marriage was 21.8 for women and 23.6
for men (Kornblum, 1994).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. 1970: Of women aged 25-29, 10% had never married (Eschleman, 1997).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. 1970: Of men aged 25-29, 20% had never married (Eschleman, 1997).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1980s and 1990s. Predictive studies about MQ shifted emphasis from
spouses' individual characteristics to dyadic processes (Larson &amp; Holman, 1994).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1980s.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. MQ theory moved toward an ecosystemic, dynamic, multidisciplinary
way of thinking (Larson &amp; Holman, 1994).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Females were documented as performing approximately twice as much
household labor as males (Blair, 1993).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Research showed that MQ dropped with the couple's transition to
parenthood, and that the change was greater for wives than for husbands. Continued
research pointed to the change being a function of duration-of-marriage effects rather
than the transition to parenthood (Glenn, 1990).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The decade saw a steep increase in the number of studies about
remarriage (Glenn, 1990).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. 1980: The marriage/divorce ratio was 2.3:1 (Whitmire, 1997).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. 1980: Of women aged 25-29, 20% had never married (Eschleman, 1997).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. 1980: of men aged 25-29, 33% had never married (Eschleman, 1997).</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1990s. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. 1990: 59% of married women with preschoolers were employed [1992
Census].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. 1990: 74% of married women with children aged 6 - 17 were employed
[1992 Census].<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. 1992: Dan Quayle commented on Murphy Brown's pregnancy (Skolnick,
1997a).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. 1993: The proportion of births occurring out of wedlock was 31%
(Furstenberg, 1996).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. 1994: The median age at first marriage was 24.5 for women and 26.7
for men (Furstenberg, 1996).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. 1994: 55% of women with children under age 6 were employed
(Furstenberg, 1996).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. 1996: The marriage/divorce ratio was 2:1 (Whitmire, 1997).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. 1997: Researchers predicted that 60% of new marriages will end in
divorce or separation (Whitmire, 1997).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. 15 August 1997: Covenant marriage choice under Louisiana state
Covenant Marriage Law became available (Caldwell, 1997; Cook, 1998).</p>
